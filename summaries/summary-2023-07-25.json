The software can be downloaded from the following link: https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/. Alternatively, it can be cloned from the GitHub repository https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git using the command \"git clone -b full-rbf-v25.0 https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git\".\n\nThe purpose of Bitcoin Core v25.0 is to introduce Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, along with some additional minor updates. Full-RBF nodes perform two functions:\n\n1) When the mempoolfullrbf=1 setting is enabled, they advertise a FULL_RBF service bit. This indicates that they accept and propagate full Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transactions.\n\n2) In addition to regular peers, full-rbf nodes connect to four additional FULL_RBF peers. This ensures that a core group of nodes reliably propagates full-RBF replacements throughout the network.\n\nIt is not necessary for everyone to run full-RBF nodes, but it would be helpful if more people did. To understand why you should run full-RBF, you can refer to the blog post by Peter Todd: https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf. And if you're interested, you can even get hats related to this initiative: https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1659996011086110720/photo/1.\n\nThe email concludes with the contact information of Peter Todd and his website address: https://petertodd.org.",
      "summaryeli15": "This message is from Michael Ford, who is discussing a new version of Bitcoin Core called v25.0. Bitcoin Core is the software that runs the Bitcoin network. The new version can be found on the Bitcoin Core website or on GitHub.\n\nThe main feature of this new version is Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code. \"RBF\" stands for \"replace-by-fee,\" which is a feature that allows users to replace a transaction they have already sent with a new one that has a higher fee. This can be useful when a transaction is taking a long time to confirm and the user wants to speed up the process. \n\nThe full-rbf peering code does two things for nodes that are running the full-rbf version:\n1) It advertises a FULL_RBF service when the \"mempoolfullrbf=1\" setting is enabled. This means that these nodes will let other nodes know that they support full-rbf transactions.\n2) It connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. This ensures that a core group of nodes is consistently propagating full-rbf replacements. \n\nIt's not necessary for everyone to run this new version, but it would be helpful if more people did. The blog post by Peter Todd, shared in the message, provides more information on why running full-rbf is beneficial.\n\nIn addition, there is a link to a tweet that shows hats related to this new version of Bitcoin Core.",

      "summary": "The message you provided is a public announcement from the LNP/BP Standards Association regarding the release of a new RGB smart contract system for Bitcoin. The association references an earlier discussion where they mentioned the potential for client-side validation to upgrade the Bitcoin layer 1 blockchain.\n\nClient-side validation refers to the process of validating transactions on the client side, rather than relying solely on the blockchain for validation. The association believes that the current Bitcoin blockchain is limiting the scalability and privacy of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and that client-side validation can address these issues.\n\nThe proposal presented in the announcement is called Prime, which aims to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol by introducing a new layer 1 that is scalable (supporting billions of transactions per minute) and fully anonymous. The majority of the validation work would be moved into the client-side validation system. This proposed upgrade does not require a softfork or miners upgrade, but it can benefit from such upgrades. It also does not require consensus or majority agreement for initial deployment, and users who are not willing to upgrade will not be affected.\n\nThe announcement states that the proposed upgrade will render Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant. It also mentions that certain features like BRC20, inscriptions, and ordinals will no longer be possible, and that proper assets like NFTs will be done using RGB smart contracts instead. This change will relieve non-users of the burden of storing, validating, and using their network bandwidth for third-party interests that they are not directly involved in.\n\nThe announcement includes a link to a white paper that further describes the proposal. The LNP/BP Standards Association is forming a working group to focus on the formal specification and reference implementation of this new layer. They welcome anyone interested in cooperating on this topic to join the working group. They also plan educational and workshop activities to better educate the community about the underlying technology and enable informed decision-making regarding its adoption.\n\nThe association emphasizes that this infrastructural effort should not be managed by a for-profit company and that funding should come through non-profit donations. They mention a fundraising campaign and provide contact information for those interested in contributing to the Bitcoin evolution.\n\nOverall, the message outlines a proposal by the LNP/BP Standards Association to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol with a new layer 1 system that addresses scalability and privacy issues through client-side validation.

      "summary": "In this email conversation, Salvatore Ingala is discussing the MATT proposal for smart contracts in Bitcoin. The MATT proposal introduces new opcodes called OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY and OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, which enhance the Script language with additional capabilities. These opcodes allow for embedding data in outputs and inputs and accessing that embedded data in the script.\n\nThe post provides the code for the implementation of these opcodes and discusses their semantics. In particular, the OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY opcode is used to verify that the script of the input matches a certain value, while the OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY opcode is used to verify the script of an output. These opcodes enable introspection, which is not possible in the current Script language.\n\nThe MATT proposal is part of a family of covenant proposals that aim to add additional functionality to Bitcoin's scripting system. It is similar to other proposals like APO, OP_CTV, and OP_VAULT in that it introduces new opcodes to the existing Script language. However, it is not yet fully formalized and is still being developed.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the MATT proposal can be used as an alternative to OP_VAULT to create vaults. The post provides an example of how to use MATT as a replacement for OP_VAULT. The example includes the structure of the P2TR outputs for the vault's initial state and unvaulting state. It also discusses the parameters of the vault, such as the alternate public key, spend delay, and recovery public key.\n\nThe MATT proposal simplifies the implementation of vaults compared to OP_VAULT by separating the data portion from the script in the taptree. This avoids the need for dynamically creating taptrees and replacing leaves in covenant-encumbered UTXOs. The taptrees of the vault's initial state and unvaulting state are pre-determined, and only the data portion of the unvaulting state's script is dynamically computed.\n\nOverall, the MATT proposal aims to provide a simple and elegant solution for implementing smart contracts in Bitcoin, particularly in the context of vaults. It is still a work in progress and requires further development and formalization.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this post, Salvatore Ingala is discussing a proposal called MATT (Merkle Adaptive Taproot Threshold), which is a framework for implementing smart contracts in Bitcoin. The post focuses on the core opcodes of MATT and how they can be used to create vaults that are similar to those built with OP_VAULT, a previous proposal for adding functionality to Bitcoin.\n\nThe two core opcodes of MATT are called OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY (CICV) and OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY (COCV). These opcodes allow users to \"embed\" data in an output and specify its script. The data can then be accessed in the next UTXO (unspent transaction output) using a similar opcode. This provides a form of introspection, which means checking that the script of an input/output matches a certain value. This is not possible in the current scripting system of Bitcoin.\n\nThe code examples provided in the post demonstrate how MATT can be used to create vaults, which are state machines that control the behavior of coins. The vaults have two states: [V] (the initial vault UTXO) and [U] (the UTXO produced by the trigger transaction during unvaulting). The trigger transaction spends one or more [V] UTXOs to the [U] state, and after a specified timelock expires, [U] can be spent to one or several destinations. The destination outputs and amounts are already decided when [V] is spent into [U]. The funds in [U] can also be recovered at any time by sending them to a specified recovery path.\n\nThe code examples also show how the opcodes are used to enforce certain conditions in the vaults. For example, the \"trigger\" script in the [V] state requires the witness to include an output index and a commitment hash (ctv-hash) that describes the withdrawal transaction. The \"withdrawal\" script in the [U] state checks that the timelock has expired and that the outputs satisfy the ctv-hash committed to in the previous transaction.\n\nOverall, the MATT proposal aims to provide a simple and elegant way to add new functionality to Bitcoin's scripting system. The opcodes allow for greater flexibility and enable the creation of more complex smart contracts. However, the post acknowledges that the implementation is still a work in progress and may require further refinement.",

Currently, the taproot annex is considered valid but not following the standard guidelines. The discussion revolves around how to standardize the taproot annex, and it seems that a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format is being considered.\n\nA TLV format is a way to structure data, where each piece of information is divided into three parts: Type, Length, and Value. This format has a lot of potential benefits, but reaching a consensus on the exact format may take a significant amount of time.\n\nIn the meantime, the author of the proposal suggests making the annex available in a non-structured form. This means that developers can use the taproot annex as it is without the need to wait for a more structured format to be finalized. This approach has immediate benefits and allows developers to take advantage of the taproot annex features today.\n\nThe proposal suggests that any annex that starts with '0' should be free-form, meaning it has no additional constraints.

      "summary": "In this detailed explanation, the author discusses a potential workaround for getting transaction packages to miners more efficiently while peer-to-peer (p2p) package relay is still under development. The author presents an idea called \"out-of-band relay\" and provides an example to illustrate it.\n\nThe scenario begins with a parent transaction A that has a fee rate of 0 sat/b. This could be a lightning commitment transaction or any other similar transaction. Additionally, there is a child transaction B that needs to be sent with a higher fee to ensure its prompt inclusion in the blockchain.\n\nCurrently, transactions with 0 sat/b fee rates like A cannot reach miners effectively. To address this, the author introduces a third transaction C, specifically designed to contain the raw transactions A and B. The author suggests using a taproot annex to include A and B within transaction C. Alternatively, a commit/reveal style inscription method could be used, but the author considers it more complex and less efficient.\n\nTo ensure transaction C propagates effectively, it should pay sufficient fees. Additionally, it should use at least one fee-contributing input from transaction B. However, it should not include any inputs from transaction A.\n\nMiners, upon receiving transaction C, would be able to detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex. They could then immediately submit these transactions to their mempool as a transaction package (A+B).\n\nThe transaction package (A+B) would replace transaction C and could be included in a block for mining. It is crucial to make sure that the combined package of A+B is more appealing to miners than transaction C. The weight of the embedded transactions in C helps in this regard.\n\nThe author also notes that the fees paid for transaction C will never be utilized because it gets replaced. Therefore, there are no additional costs associated with using this package relay scheme, except in the situation where the weight of A+B is very low, and B needs to pay a higher fee rate than necessary to ensure the replacement of C.\n\nIf not all miners adopt this incentive-compatible replacement approach, there is a possibility that transaction C might still be mined. However, this is less likely if the fee rate for C is kept to a minimum. If transaction C is indeed included in a block, the operation can be retried with modified versions of B and C. However, the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited in this case.\n\nOverall, the author suggests using this out-of-band relay scheme as a potential solution to efficiently deliver transaction packages to miners. The intention behind presenting this idea is to stimulate discussion and consider potential alternate use cases. It is important to note that the author's support for this implementation is not explicitly expressed.",

It's important to note that this idea may have some drawbacks, and the explanation is purely for informative purposes.\n\nTo understand this concept, let's consider a scenario where we have two transactions: transaction A and transaction B. Transaction A is a parent transaction and doesn't offer any fee (0 sat/b). On the other hand, transaction B is a child transaction with a fee. However, these transactions cannot reach miners under normal circumstances.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the proposed workaround suggests introducing a third transaction, called transaction C, which would contain the raw transactions A and B in what is referred to as a taproot annex. Alternatively, a commit/reveal style inscription could be used instead, but it is considered more complex and less efficient.\n\nTo ensure that transaction C is properly propagated and reaches miners, it would need to include sufficient fees. Additionally, it would need to use at least one of the same fee-contributing inputs as transaction B, but not any inputs from transaction A.\n\nWhen miners receive transaction C, they can detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and immediately include them in their mempool as a transaction package.

While there may be some risks and considerations associated with this approach, it opens up the opportunity for discussion and exploration of different use cases and perspectives within cryptocurrency transactions.",

No increase in the size or cost of transactions.\n2. Resulting transactions blend in with other transactions and can't be distinguished.\n3. Transactions can't be linked to a silent payment address.\n4. No sender-receiver interaction is required.\n5. No linking of multiple payments to the same sender.\n6.

      "summaryeli15": "The passage you provided is a proposal for a new feature in the Bitcoin protocol called Silent Payments. It addresses the issue of maintaining privacy when using Bitcoin transactions and introduces a solution that eliminates the need for interactive communication between the sender and receiver.\n\nCurrently, in order to maintain privacy, it is recommended to use a new address for each Bitcoin transaction. This requires a secure interaction between the sender and receiver so that the receiver can provide a fresh address. However, this interaction is often infeasible or undesirable.\n\nTo solve this problem, various protocols have been proposed that use a static payment address and notifications sent via the blockchain. While these protocols eliminate the need for interaction, they come with their own limitations, such as increased costs for one-time payments and a noticeable footprint in the blockchain that can reveal metadata about the sender and receiver.\n\nThe Silent Payments proposal aims to address these limitations by presenting a solution that eliminates the need for interaction and notifications, while also protecting the privacy of both the sender and receiver. However, this solution requires wallets to scan the blockchain in order to detect payments, which poses a challenge for lightweight clients.\n\nThe goals of the Silent Payments protocol are as follows:\n\n1. No increase in the size or cost of transactions.\n2. Transactions should blend in with other Bitcoin transactions and not be distinguishable.\n3. Transactions should not be linked to a silent payment address by an outside observer.\n4. No interaction is required between the sender and receiver.\n5.

It describes how Bob, the receiver, publishes a public key as a silent payment address. Alice, the sender, discovers Bob's address and creates a destination output for Bob using a private key and the public key of the address. The protocol also explains how multiple outputs can be created, how to prevent address reuse, and how to handle multiple inputs in a transaction.\n\nAdditionally, the proposal suggests the use of a spend and scan key to minimize the risk to Bob's private key, as well as the use of labels to differentiate incoming payments and manage change outputs.\n\nOverall, the Silent Payments proposal aims to provide a solution that enhances privacy in Bitcoin transactions while addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

      "summary": "In this message, the sender, ThomasV, is proposing an extension to BOLT-11, a specification for Lightning Network invoices. He suggests that invoices should be able to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts.\n\nThe use case for this extension is to address situations where services, such as submarine swaps and JIT (Just-In-Time) channels, require a prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place. In both cases, the service provider receives a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage. They must then send funds on-chain and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when claiming the payment.\n\nDue to the uncertainty of whether the client will actually claim the payment, service providers often ask for a prepayment to cover the mining fees. Submarine swaps can ask for prepayment because they use dedicated client software. However, competitors like the Boltz exchange, which require a dedicated wallet, cannot easily ask for prepayment. This vulnerability exposes them to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks where an attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of JIT channels, service providers want to protect against mining fee attacks. Some services, like Phoenix, ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. However, this makes them custodians of the funds from a legal perspective, which may be subject to regulation such as the European MICA regulation. Competitors like Electrum, who refuse to offer custodian services, are excluded from this type of protection.\n\nTo address these issues, ThomasV proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The proposed semantics for bundled payments are as follows: the invoice contains two preimages and two amounts (prepayment and main payment). The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, the prepayment should be failed with a MPP (multi-path payments) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts the on-chain transaction. It is important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.\n\nWhile this proposal does not prevent the service provider from stealing the prepayment, ThomasV argues that this risk already exists and that it would level the playing field for competition among lightning service providers. Currently, using certain services requires a dedicated client like Loop, and competitors without an established user base running such a client are exposed to the mining fee attack. ACINQ, a Lightning Network development company, could also benefit from this proposal as it would allow them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. \n\nThomasV believes that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 and not through new specifications like BOLT-12 or onion messages. He argues that adding new messages would unnecessarily complicate the process, and instead suggests achieving the proposed functionality in a non-interactive way.\n\nOverall, ThomasV's proposal aims to address the need for bundling payments in invoices to support situations where prepayments are required for mining fees in non-custodian exchanges.",
      "summaryeli15": "Good morning! I would like to explain a proposal to extend BOLT-11 in detail, specifically regarding invoices that contain two bundled payments. This proposal is aimed at addressing a specific use case where services require prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place. Let's explore the details.\n\nThere are two scenarios in which this proposal would be useful: submarine swaps and JIT channels. In both cases, the service provider receives a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage (a unique code required to claim the payment). As a result, they need to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, so service providers currently ask for a prepayment of mining fees to protect themselves. Submarine swaps, for example, can ask for a prepayment because their dedicated client software, like Loop by Lightning Labs, can handle it through a \"no show penalty.\" However, competitors who do not require a dedicated wallet, like the Boltz exchange, cannot easily implement this feature. Showing multiple invoices to be paid simultaneously would be impractical for them.\n\nThis creates a vulnerability for Boltz, as it is susceptible to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks where an attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees. To protect against such attacks, providers offering JIT channels need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. This approach, as seen in services like Phoenix, makes them custodians, which has legal implications under European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from this particular market.\n\nTo address these issues, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. This means that the invoice would contain two preimages and two amounts: the prepayment and the main payment. The receiver would then wait for all HTLCs of both payments to arrive before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, they would fail the prepayment with a Multiple Path Payments (MPP) timeout.\n\nOnce the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver would fulfill the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcast their on-chain transaction. It's important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment. Essentially, this proposal does not prevent the service provider from stealing the prepayment, but that risk already exists today.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to level the playing field for competition between lightning service providers. Currently, utilizing Loop requires a dedicated client, placing competitors without an established user base for such clients at risk of mining fee attacks. Additionally, ACINQ, a company involved in the Lightning Network, could benefit from this proposal as it would enable them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian, thus avoiding potential regulatory issues under European MICA.\n\nLastly, it is worth mentioning that this change should be implemented within BOLT-11 and not with BOLT-12 or onion messages. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be achieved in a non-interactive way. While some initial feedback suggested BOLT-12 or OM as a solution, I believe that would unnecessarily complicate matters.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the proposal.

      "summary": "This explanation will provide a detailed understanding of the given information.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, the PR (Pull Request) branch HEAD (the latest commit) was identified as 0538ad7 during the review club meeting mentioned in the context.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, each wallet transaction has a transaction state. This transaction state plays a role in determining which transactions the user is allowed to spend and which transactions contribute to the user's balance. Further details about these transaction states can be found in the provided link.\n\nPreviously, review club #27145 discussed wallet transaction states and conflicts. On the master branch, wallet transactions were considered conflicted only when the conflicting transaction was successfully included in a mined block. However, if a transaction was only conflicted due to another transaction in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), it was considered as TxStateInactive. This distinction could confuse users as it made their funds briefly \"disappear\".\n\nThe purpose of this PR is to treat transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. This is achieved by introducing another transaction state specifically for mempool-conflicted transactions, called TxStateMempoolConflicted. Additionally, the PR keeps track of the conflicting transactions using a data structure called MempoolConflicts. It is a map that associates wallet transaction hashes with sets of hashes representing their conflicting transactions in the mempool.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, it is not explicitly mentioned whether it has been reviewed or not. However, it asks if the review was done from a conceptual perspective (concept ACK), approach perspective (approach ACK), testing perspective (tested ACK), or if the review identified significant issues (NACK).\n\nIn terms of bug fixing or feature addition, this PR is considered a feature addition. The feature is to address the confusion caused by briefly \"disappearing\" funds and to provide better clarity in transaction states.\n\nThe trade-offs of considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted instead of inactive are not explicitly mentioned. However, some potential trade-offs could be the complexity of the code, potential performance impact, and the need for additional memory to store the conflict information.\n\nThe first commit of this PR is intended to fix a bug or add a feature. It is not mentioned if the first commit changes any existing behavior.\n\nThe addition of the MempoolConflicts map serves the purpose of keeping track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool. By using this map, the wallet can easily check for conflicts rather than relying solely on the mapTxSpends mechanism. This helps in efficiently managing and tracking conflicts.\n\nThe benefit of introducing another transaction state, TxStateMempoolConflicted, instead of relying on TxStateConflicted alone is to differentiate between conflicts arising from mined blocks and conflicts arising from the mempool. This differentiation provides a more accurate representation of the transaction's status.\n\nIt is not explicitly mentioned if a user can abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. However, it can be inferred that with this PR, a user should be able to abandon such a transaction.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, the transaction state of a previously mempool-conflicted transaction would depend on the specific implementation. However, it can be expected that the transaction will retain its mempool-conflicted state unless the reload process explicitly changes it.\n\nThe provided information does not specify whether the tests added to wallet_conflicts.py fail on the master branch.\n\nAlthough this PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made in this PR can indirectly affect the balance calculation of the wallet. By properly tracking and handling conflicts, the wallet can more accurately determine the available balance.\n\nTxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not explicitly stated to be treated the same in memory. However, since the PR introduces a specific transaction state for mempool conflicts, it can be inferred that they are not treated exactly the same.\n\nIt is not mentioned if there are any specific additional test cases that should be implemented.\n\nThe second commit modifies wallet_abandonconflict.py because it is necessary to update this script to reflect the changes made in the PR. This ensures that the script continues to work correctly and is compatible with the updated wallet transaction states.",
      "summaryeli15": "At the time of this review club meeting, the PR (pull request) branch HEAD (latest commit) was identified as 0538ad7. This information is useful for tracking and discussing changes in the Bitcoin Core codebase.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a transaction state, which is a designation that describes the state of the transaction. These transaction states help the wallet determine which transactions can be spent and which ones should be counted towards a user's balance.\n\nPreviously, there was a discussion about wallet transaction states and conflicts in review club #27145. This would have covered how conflicts arise and impact the transaction states.\n\nOn the master branch (the main development branch), wallet transactions were considered conflicting only when the conflicting transaction was included in a mined block in the blockchain. However, if a transaction conflicted with another transaction that was still in the mempool (the pool of pending transactions), it was considered as TxStateInactive instead of being marked as conflicted. This could lead to confusion for users because it appeared as if their funds briefly disappeared.\n\nThis PR aims to address this confusion by treating transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. It introduces another transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted specifically for mempool-conflicted transactions. Additionally, it includes a new data structure called MempoolConflicts, which is a map that associates wallet transactions with the hashes of their conflicting mempool transactions.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the question asks whether the person reviewing the PR provided a Concept ACK (concept acknowledged), Approach ACK (approach acknowledged), Tested ACK (tested and acknowledged), or NACK (not acknowledged). The review approach would refer to the specific approach taken to examine the PR, such as looking at code changes, the rationale, or running tests.\n\nIn terms of bug fix or feature addition, this PR is considered a feature addition. The feature it adds is the ability to treat mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted instead of inactive.\n\nThere are trade-offs to consider with treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted rather than inactive. One trade-off is that it may increase confusion for users as their funds may appear to be unavailable for a longer duration. However, it provides a more accurate representation of the conflict status, ensuring that all conflicts are appropriately accounted for.\n\nThe first commit of this PR is necessary as it introduces the changes required for treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted. It does impact existing behavior by modifying how conflicts are handled in the wallet transaction state and balance calculations.\n\nThe MempoolConflicts map is added to efficiently keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool for a particular wallet transaction. Instead of checking for conflicts in the existing mapTxSpends data structure, which may not provide a direct mapping to mempool conflicts, the MempoolConflicts map provides a streamlined way to associate wallet transactions with their corresponding mempool conflicts.\n\nThe benefit of adding a separate transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of using TxStateConflicted for mempool-related conflicts is to clearly distinguish between conflicts that are in the mempool and conflicts that are already included in the blockchain. This helps in providing more accurate information about the actual state of the transaction and its impact on the user's balance.\n\nWith this PR, a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict, as it treats those transactions as conflicted. Therefore, a user would have the option to abandon the transaction if desired.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, the previously mempool-conflicted transaction would still retain its transaction state of TxStateMempoolConflicted. Reloading the wallet does not change the state of the transaction.\n\nThe tests added to wallet_conflicts.py may or may not fail on the master branch, depending on the specific test cases and the current state of the codebase. The question is asking for confirmation if those tests failed during review.\n\nAlthough this PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made in this PR impact the balance calculation indirectly. By accurately tracking and categorizing conflicted transactions, the balance calculation will be able to reflect the correct state of the user's funds, considering all conflicting transactions within the mempool as well.\n\nTxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not treated the same in memory. They represent different states and have different implications. TxStateConflicted refers to transactions that have conflicts in the blockchain, whereas TxStateMempoolConflicted represents transactions that are conflicted within the mempool.\n\nDepending on the specific requirements or scenarios, additional test cases could be implemented to ensure that the changes made in this PR address any uncovered edge cases or potential issues related to mempool-conflicted transactions.\n\nThe modification of wallet_abandonconflict.py in the second commit is necessary because it updates the code to support the new transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) and the associated changes made in the PR. It ensures that the abandonment of conflicting transactions within the mempool is appropriately handled.",

      "summary": "In this paragraph, it is mentioned that the PR branch HEAD was d25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487 at the time of this review club meeting. This PR (pull request) is a follow-up to PR 25325, which was reviewed on March 8 of this year. The request is to review at least the notes from that review club meeting.\n\nThe paragraph then discusses the -dbcache configuration option, which determines the amount of memory used for the coins cache and other uses of memory in the database. By default, it is set to 450 MiB. The function CalculateCacheSizes() is responsible for determining the cache sizes.\n\nUsing less memory than allowed decreases the coins cache hit ratio, which refers to the fraction of lookups that find the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) in the cache. On the other hand, using more memory than specified can lead to crashing of the bitcoind software on memory-restricted systems.\n\nTo ensure accurate accounting of the amount of memory used by the cache, it is important to consider that when a program requests X bytes of dynamic memory, the C++ runtime library internally allocates slightly more for the memory allocator's metadata (overhead). This means that logical memory, which is requested by the program, is not the same as physical memory.\n\nThe memory allocator metadata is complex and depends on factors like the machine architecture and the memory model. This complexity makes it difficult to directly map logical memory size to physical size.\n\nTo address this issue, Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage() that approximates the conversion from logical memory size to physical size. The MallocUsage() function takes an allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size.\n\nThe source file memusage.h contains multiple versions of the DynamicUsage() function for different data types that might be allocated in the system. All these versions of DynamicUsage() use the MallocUsage() function.\n\nThe PR #25325 introduced a new DynamicUsage() overload specifically for the pool memory resource. This new version calculates the overall coins cache size, which ensures that the cache stays within the configured cache size.\n\nThe newly added DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource is only called from the function CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().\n\nMoving on, it asks whether the PR has been reviewed and what approach was taken for the review. It enquires about whether the review was a Concept Acknowledgment (ACK), an Approach ACK, a Tested ACK, or a Not Acknowledgment (NACK).\n\nIn the master branch (without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has multiple templated arguments. The purpose of these templated arguments is to handle different types of allocations. By comparing it to the overload immediately above it on line 170, one can understand the need for different templated arguments.\n\nThe DynamicUsage() overload on the master branch works by adding together various values to calculate the overall memory usage. These values depend on the specific allocation and are determined by the individual DynamicUsage() overloads for different data types.\n\nThe paragraph then raises a specific question about why m.bucket_count() is part of the DynamicUsage() calculation. It suggests that the memory for bucket allocation should already be accounted for in the resource \"chunks\". This seems to refer to the memory already allocated for storing data in the cache.\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location. Additionally, it indicates that m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. The advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() is not explicitly stated in the given information.\n\nLastly, there is an optional question about cachedCoinsUsage and why it is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()). Unfortunately, the context and information provided do not offer any insights into the purpose or significance of cachedCoinsUsage and its addition to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()).",

It is suggested that you review the notes or details for that review club meeting.\n\nThe -dbcache configuration option is responsible for determining the amount of memory used for the coins cache and other \"database\" uses of memory. By default, it is set to 450 MiB (megabytes). This memory is used to cache coins and improve performance by reducing lookups in the actual database. It is important to note that using less memory than specified could result in a lower cache hit ratio, meaning more lookups would have to go to the actual database. On the other hand, using more memory than specified could cause issues on systems with limited memory.\n\nTo ensure efficient memory usage, it is crucial to have an accurate accounting of the memory used by the cache. While it doesn't have to be exact, it should be reasonably close. However, there is a distinction between logical memory (the memory requested by a program) and physical memory (the actual memory allocated by the system).\n\nWhen a program requests X bytes of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, it internally allocates slightly more memory to account for metadata or overhead used by the memory allocator. This metadata is complex and depends on various factors such as machine architecture and memory model.\n\nTo properly size the cache and account for this metadata overhead, Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage().

This overload is only called from the CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() function.\n\nThe question asks if you reviewed the PR and what your review approach was. In software development, \"ACK\" typically stands for \"acknowledged,\" indicating that you have reviewed and approved the PR. \"Concept ACK\" means you agree with the overall concept/approach, \"approach ACK\" indicates agreement with the implementation approach, and \"tested ACK\" means you have tested the code changes and verified they work correctly. \"NACK\" means you do not approve or agree with the changes.\n\nIn the master branch (without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has many templated arguments to support different data types that may be allocated.

It takes into account various values that contribute to memory usage.\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location. The exact location is not mentioned in the provided information. However, it states that m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. The advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() could be that it was previously included in the calculation under a different context or logic, but now it is no longer relevant or necessary.\n\nThe term \"cachedCoinsUsage\" is mentioned, but without further context or information, it is difficult to determine its exact meaning or purpose. Similarly, the reason for adding it to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in the CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() function cannot be determined without additional details.",

      "summary": "The PR (Pull Request) branch HEAD, which refers to the current state of the code repository, was identified as \"faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4\" during the review club meeting.\n\nIn the codebase, there exists a data structure called \"mapRelay,\" which is a map that stores all the transactions that have been relayed to any peer recently. Alongside mapRelay, there is another data structure called \"g_relay_expiration,\" which is a sorted list of expiration times for mapRelay entries. The entries in mapRelay and their associated expiration times are maintained for a duration of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer requests a transaction through a \"getdata\" message, but the said transaction is no longer present in the mempool (the collection of unconfirmed transactions), it can be fetched from mapRelay and served to the requesting peer.\n\nmapRelay has existed in the codebase for a significant period, even since the initial commit to the GitHub repository. Although it was crucial at that time, its necessity has diminished over time. For instance, Bitcoin Core now attempts to retrieve transactions directly from the mempool before seeking them in mapRelay. Various reasons have contributed to the preservation of mapRelay until now, as mentioned in the linked comment. However, most of these reasons have become irrelevant due to other improvements made in the codebase.\n\nThe current Pull Request aims to remove mapRelay entirely and instead introduce a new data structure called \"m_most_recent_block_txs.\" The purpose of m_most_recent_block_txs is to only keep track of transactions from the most recently mined block.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, it is not explicitly mentioned how the review was conducted. However, the question prompts the responder to pick from a set of options: \"Concept ACK\" (acknowledging the concept), \"approach ACK\" (acknowledging the approach), \"tested ACK\" (acknowledging that the code has been tested), or \"NACK\" (negative acknowledgment, indicating a disapproval). The answer to this question depends on the reviewer's response.\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is difficult to determine due to the way it is utilized. As mentioned in the linked comment, the memory usage fluctuates based on the number and size of transactions being relayed. Additionally, the memory consumed by mapRelay can be influenced by the frequency of receiving getdata requests for transactions that are no longer in the mempool. Therefore, due to these dynamic factors, it is challenging to pinpoint the precise memory requirements of mapRelay.\n\nThe introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of maintaining a separate data structure (mapRelay) for relaying recently broadcasted transactions to peers. By focusing solely on transactions from the most recent block, unnecessary memory usage and complexity associated with mapRelay can be eliminated. Whether this introduction is necessary depends on the specific requirements and goals of the codebase. However, considering the reduction in scope and the removal of mapRelay in the long term, it seems reasonable to introduce m_most_recent_block_txs as a replacement.\n\nIn terms of memory requirements, m_most_recent_block_txs is expected to have lower memory requirements compared to mapRelay. This is because mapRelay stores all recently relayed transactions, whereas m_most_recent_block_txs only keeps track of the transactions from the most recent block. As a result, the number of transactions stored in m_most_recent_block_txs is likely to be significantly smaller than those in mapRelay, leading to reduced memory usage.\n\nAs a result of removing mapRelay and introducing m_most_recent_block_txs, transactions may be available for a shorter time period than before. This is because mapRelay maintained the transactions for 15 minutes, while m_most_recent_block_txs focuses solely on transactions from the most recent block. Once a new block is mined, the transactions from the previous block will not be present in m_most_recent_block_txs.\n\nAn additional downside of removing mapRelay could be the potential limitation in providing requested transactions that are no longer in the mempool. In the current system, if a peer requests a transaction that is not in the mempool, it can be served through mapRelay. However, with the removal of mapRelay, such transactions might not be available unless they are from the most recent block. Therefore, it could impact the ability to fulfill certain transaction retrieval requests.",
      "summaryeli15": "At the time of this review club meeting, the PR branch HEAD (also known as the latest commit) was faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, there is a data structure called mapRelay that stores all the transactions that have been relayed to any peer recently. It is accompanied by another data structure called g_relay_expiration, which is a sorted list of expiration times for the entries in mapRelay. Entries in mapRelay and g_relay_expiration stay for a duration of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer asks for a transaction by sending a getdata message, but the transaction is no longer in the mempool (the collection of unconfirmed transactions), it can be retrieved from mapRelay instead.\n\nmapRelay has existed for a long time, even since the first commit on GitHub. It was originally essential but has seen reduced usage over time. Bitcoin Core now attempts to fetch transactions directly from the mempool instead of relying solely on mapRelay. There have been various reasons why mapRelay wasn't removed earlier, which are explained in a comment mentioned in the text. However, most of these reasons have become obsolete due to other improvements.\n\nThis PR, or pull request, removes mapRelay altogether and introduces a new data structure called m_most_recent_block_txs. This new data structure is responsible for keeping track of only the transactions from the most recent block.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the text asks for the reviewer's approach. It could be Concept ACK (i.e., the reviewer understands and agrees with the overall concept), approach ACK (i.e., the reviewer agrees with the approach taken to solve the problem), tested ACK (i.e., the reviewer has tested the changes and they work as intended), or NACK (i.e., the reviewer does not approve of the changes for some reason).\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is mentioned to be hard to determine because the comment suggests that its memory usage can vary significantly. The size of the data structure itself may not accurately represent the actual memory consumption due to various factors such as optimizations, fragmentation, and the inclusion of additional data associated with each entry.\n\nThe introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of keeping track of only the transactions from the most recent block. Instead of relying on mapRelay, which stores all recently relayed transactions, only the relevant transactions from the most recent block are tracked. Whether it is necessary to introduce m_most_recent_block_txs depends on the specific requirements and goals of the system. It may be deemed necessary to have a more focused data structure for improved efficiency or enhanced functionality.\n\nThe memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs compared to mapRelay are not mentioned in the text. More details would be needed to determine the exact memory requirements for both data structures.\n\nAs a result of this change, there may be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time than before. Since mapRelay stored transactions for 15 minutes, if m_most_recent_block_txs has a different retention policy or if it only keeps track of a subset of transactions, the availability duration may change accordingly.\n\nPossible downsides of removing mapRelay could include the loss of certain functionalities or the need for alternative methods to address those functionalities. It is also possible that the removal of mapRelay could introduce new bugs or issues due to changes in the codebase. Proper testing and consideration of potential impacts would be necessary before removing mapRelay.",

In this case, it is a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5.\n\nThe libbitcoinkernel project aims to separate Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from other non-consensus components in the codebase. In previous PRs (#25527, #24410, and #20158), efforts have been made to address this decoupling.\n\nOne of the recent PRs (#27636) introduces a new interface called kernel::Notifications. This interface allows node implementations, like KernelNotifications, to define the desired behavior for events. For example, when the consensus engine requires a shutdown, whether expected or unexpected.\n\nTo support these behaviors, PR #27711 adds two new notification methods to the kernel::Notifications interface: kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods enable the node to implement the necessary actions during a shutdown.\n\nAdditionally, PR #27711 moves the shutdown files and the remaining uses of uiInterface out of the kernel code. This process was initiated in PR #27636.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the question asks whether the reviewer reviewed the Pull Request (PR) with a \"Concept ACK\" (agreeing with the concept), \"approach ACK\" (agreeing with the approach taken), \"tested ACK\" (agreeing with the testing done), or \"NACK\" (disagreeing with any of the aforementioned aspects). The second part of the question asks for the review approach taken by the reviewer.\n\nThe query also asks why the startShutdown method is present in both kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h. It is unclear from the information provided why this duplication exists and whether it is intentional or an oversight.\n\nThe role of fRequestShutdown in relation to this PR is not explicitly described here, so it is difficult to provide further details. It could be a variable or a flag that is used to communicate a request for a shutdown to the kernel functions. However, more information is needed to give a precise answer.\n\nThe notification interface contributes to the decoupling of non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel by providing a separate interface through which the node can interact with the consensus engine. By having these clear notification methods defined in the interface, the non-consensus code can trigger the necessary behavior without being tightly coupled to the consensus engine.\n\nIn the new setup, the startShutdown and fatalError notifications flow from the producer (the node implementation) to the consumer (the consensus engine). When a shutdown is required, the node implementation will call the startShutdown method in the kernel::Notifications interface, which will be picked up by the consensus engine. Similarly, if a fatal error occurs, the node implementation will trigger the fatalError method, which will also be consumed by the consensus engine.\n\nThere is no information provided regarding potential race conditions or synchronization issues with the notification interface. It would require a more in-depth analysis of the code and the specific context to determine if any such issues exist.\n\nThe reason for KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested being a reference value is not explained in the given description. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of this reference value. As for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown, it is unclear what aspect of shutting down could be tackled differently without more details or context.",
      "summaryeli15": "The PR branch HEAD refers to a specific version of code in a project called libbitcoinkernel. In this case, the version is identified by the code \"a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5\". During a review club meeting, this specific version was discussed.\n\nThe libbitcoinkernel project aims to separate the consensus engine of Bitcoin Core from other modules that are not directly related to consensus, such as various indices, in the codebase. This separation makes it easier to work on the consensus engine independently. Previous pull requests (PRs) related to libbitcoinkernel, listed as #25527, #24410, and #20158, have been covered before.\n\nPR #27636 introduced a new interface called kernel::Notifications. This interface allows node implementations (for example, KernelNotifications) to define the desired behavior for specific events. One type of event that can be triggered is when the consensus engine requires a shutdown, either expectedly or unexpectedly.\n\nPR #27711 builds upon the previous PR and adds two new methods, kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods enable the node to implement the necessary behavior for a shutdown. Additionally, this PR also moves the shutdown files and any remaining uses of uiInterface out of the kernel code, as was initiated in PR #27636.\n\nThe question \"Did you review the PR?\" is asking whether the person being addressed has reviewed PR #27711. The options for answering are \"Concept ACK\" (agree with the idea), \"approach ACK\" (agree with the approach taken), \"tested ACK\" (agree that it has been tested), or \"NACK\" (disagree or have concerns). The question \"What was your review approach?\" is asking about the specific approach the person used during the review process.\n\nThe next question asks why there is a definition of the method startShutdown in both kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h. This could be due to the need for the method to be implemented both at the interface level and at the specific node implementation level. The interface defines the general structure, while the node implementation provides the behavior specific to that node.\n\nThe term fRequestShutdown refers to a variable/function in the code. Its role in this PR is not explicitly mentioned, so it is unclear how it relates to the new notification methods. It might have a connection to triggering a shutdown by indicating that a shutdown has been requested, potentially by some external factor.\n\nThe notification interface contributes to the decoupling of most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel by providing a way for nodes to define their own behavior in response to specific events. This means that the non-consensus code can be separated from the consensus engine and handled externally by different nodes, making the codebase more modular and adaptable.\n\nIn the new setup, the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications starts with the producer, which is the consensus engine. When the consensus engine determines that a shutdown is required, it triggers the startShutdown notification. This notification is then consumed by the node implementation, which defines the behavior for the shutdown. The fatalError notification serves a similar role but is used for unexpected shutdowns that require immediate termination.\n\nThere might be potential race conditions or synchronization issues with the use of the notification interface in this context. It depends on how the notifications are implemented and how different parts of the code interact with them. Without more specific information, it is challenging to identify these potential issues.\n\nThe variable KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested being a reference value means that it refers to the same memory location as the variable it is referencing. It could be used to indicate whether a shutdown has been requested, potentially by setting its value to true. Alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown could include using a separate boolean variable or using a different flag or signal mechanism suited for the specific context of the code.",

      "summary": "In this week's newsletter, there is a summary of a discussion about extending BOLT11 invoices, a limited weekly series about mempool policy, updates to Bitcoin clients and services, new releases and release candidates, and changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.\n\nThe first topic discussed is a proposal to extend BOLT11 invoices to request two payments. Thomas Voegtlin suggested on the Lightning-Dev mailing list that BOLT11 invoices should be able to request two separate payments from a spender, each with a separate secret and amount. This could be useful for submarine swaps and Just-In-Time (JIT) channels. However, there are concerns that if the user doesn't disclose their secret, the service provider won't receive any compensation and will incur on-chain costs for no gain. Voegtlin suggests that allowing BOLT11 invoices to contain two separate commitments to secrets, each for a different amount, would solve this problem. The proposal received comments from others, with some disagreeing and suggesting alternative approaches.\n\nThe next topic is about the ossification of BOLT11. Matt Corallo mentioned that it has been challenging to get all Lightning Network (LN) implementations to update their BOLT11 support to allow invoices that don't contain an amount. Therefore, adding an additional field to support requesting two payments may also be impractical at this time. Others suggested adding support to offers instead of invoices. There is an ongoing discussion about this topic.\n\nThe newsletter also includes a limited weekly series about transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explains the differences in policies between nodes and the impact on transaction propagation. Having identical policies across the network helps converge mempool contents and improves transaction relay, fee estimation, and compact block relay. The newsletter also mentions how the choice of mempool capacity on an individual node affects the availability of fee-bumping tools.\n\nIn the section highlighting updates to Bitcoin wallets and services, several releases and announcements are mentioned. Greenlight, a non-custodial CLN node service provider, has open-sourced its client libraries and language bindings. Tapsim, a script execution debugging and visualization tool for tapscript, has been announced. Bitcoin Keeper has released version 1.0.4 of its mobile wallet, which now includes coinjoin support using the Whirlpool protocol. EttaWallet, a mobile Lightning wallet, has also been announced with a focus on usability. BTC Warp has released a proof-of-concept for zkSNARK-based block header sync using zkSNARKs. lnprototest v0.0.4, a test suite for the Lightning Network, has also been released.\n\nThe newsletter then provides updates on new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects, such as Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, BDK, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition. It highlights the notable changes in these projects and encourages users to upgrade to new releases or help test release candidates.\n\nLastly, the newsletter mentions helping Bitcoin-based businesses integrate scaling technology, although no specific details are provided.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers various topics related to extending BOLT11 invoices, mempool policy, updates to Bitcoin clients and services, new releases and release candidates, and changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.",

      "summary": "In this week's newsletter, several topics related to Bitcoin and its infrastructure are discussed in detail.\n\nThe first topic is regarding preventing coinjoin pinning with v3 transaction relay. Greg Sanders proposed a method on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list to prevent the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Pinning refers to a situation where one of the participants in a coinjoin transaction can create a conflicting transaction that prevents the coinjoin transaction from confirming. Sanders suggests that coinjoin-style transactions can avoid this problem by having each participant initially spend their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by either a signature from all participants in the coinjoin or by just the participant after a timelock expires. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent pinning.\n\nThe second topic is a limited weekly series about mempool policy, which discusses transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explains why Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than allowed by consensus and how wallets can use that policy effectively. It also discusses the concept of network-wide resources and the importance of protecting shared network resources to ensure scalability, upgradeability, and accessibility of maintaining a full node.\n\nThe newsletter also highlights popular questions and answers on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange. Some of the questions include why Bitcoin nodes accept blocks with excluded transactions, why soft forks restrict the existing ruleset, and the reason for the default Lightning Network channel limit. The answers provide detailed explanations and insights into these topics.\n\nThe newsletter concludes with updates on new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects.

      "summaryeli15": "This week's newsletter covers several topics related to Bitcoin development and infrastructure. \n\nThe first topic discussed is preventing the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Coinjoin is a method used to increase the privacy of Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple transactions into a single transaction. However, there is a risk that one participant in the coinjoin can create a conflicting transaction that prevents the coinjoin transaction from being confirmed. The proposed solution is to create a rule for version 3 (v3) transaction relay that would allow coinjoin-style transactions to be more secure. This would involve each participant in the coinjoin initially spending their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by a signature from all participants or by a single participant after a specific time has passed. This would make it more difficult for one participant to create a conflicting transaction. \n\nThe second topic is a series about mempool policy, which is related to how transactions are selected to be included in the mempool and eventually added to a block. Bitcoin Core, the most popular Bitcoin software implementation, has a more restrictive mempool policy than what is allowed by the consensus rules. This helps protect network resources and allows for future protocol development. The post also mentions the challenge of balancing network growth and scalability while keeping the cost of running a node affordable.\n\nThe newsletter also includes a section highlighting popular questions and answers from the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, a platform where users can ask and answer questions about Bitcoin. Some of the questions discussed include why Bitcoin nodes accept blocks with excluded transactions, why soft forks restrict the existing ruleset, and why Bitcoin Core uses ancestor scores to select transactions.\n\nLastly, the newsletter provides updates on new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects. This includes changes and improvements to Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition.\n\nOverall, the newsletter provides a detailed overview of proposed solutions, mempool policy, popular questions, and updates in the Bitcoin development and infrastructure space.",

The paper was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in the year 2023 and can be found at the following URL: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/938.\n\nIn the paper, the authors discuss a concept called \"Musketeer\" which is designed to address the issue of rebalancing in payment channel networks. Payment channel networks are a type of technology used in cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, where users can create a private channel between themselves to conduct transactions without involving the entire network.\n\nRebalancing refers to the process of ensuring that payment channels within the network have sufficient funds on both sides to facilitate transactions. This is important because if funds become imbalanced, it can limit the ability of users to transact and may cause channels to become congested or even unusable.\n\nThe authors propose a solution called Musketeer that aims to make the rebalancing process incentive-compatible. This means that users are motivated to participate in the rebalancing process by offering them some sort of reward or benefit. Incentive compatibility is crucial because it ensures that users have a reason to perform the necessary actions to keep the payment channels balanced.\n\nThe paper delves into the technical details of how Musketeer achieves incentive compatibility. It likely discusses algorithms, protocols, or mechanisms that can be used to incentivize users to participate in rebalancing. These details may involve concepts from game theory, cryptography, or distributed systems, which can be complex but are essential for understanding the proposal.\n\nOverall, the research paper explores the problem of rebalancing in payment channel networks and presents Musketeer as a potential solution that incentivizes users to take part in rebalancing. It is important to note that, to fully comprehend the paper, a background in cryptography, distributed systems, and game theory might be helpful.",

      "summary": "The provided citation is for a paper titled \"The curious case of the half-half Bitcoin ECDSA nonces\" authored by Dylan Rowe, Joachim Breitner, and Nadia Heninger. This paper is published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive, specifically under the identifier 2023/841.\n\nThe paper addresses an interesting phenomenon related to the use of nonces in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) within the context of Bitcoin. ECDSA is a widely used cryptographic algorithm for generating digital signatures.\n\nThe authors noticed that certain Bitcoin transactions appeared to be using nonces that followed a specific pattern. A nonce in cryptography refers to a randomly generated number used only once. It plays a critical role in ensuring the security of cryptographic algorithms.\n\nThe motivation behind this research stems from the fact that in 2013, there was a well-publicized incident where a compromised cryptographic library used in Android's Java implementation resulted in a large number of weak ECDSA private keys being generated. This incident raised concerns about the randomness and security of nonces.\n\nThe authors' study focuses on a specific subset of nonces that exhibit a pattern where the top half and bottom half of the nonce are roughly equal. This pattern seems to occur more frequently than one would expect from a truly random set of nonces.\n\nTo investigate this phenomenon, the authors collected a large dataset of Bitcoin signatures from the Bitcoin blockchain. They then analyzed the distribution of the top and bottom halves of each nonce within the ECDSA signatures.\n\nTheir findings reveal that the occurrence of the half-half nonce pattern is statistically significant, indicating that it is not just a coincidence. The authors discuss possible explanations for this phenomenon, including the influence of biased random number generators or implementation bugs.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant as the randomness of nonces is crucial for the security of cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA. If the nonces are not sufficiently random, it could potentially lead to the compromise of Bitcoin private keys, and subsequently, the theft of funds.\n\nTo ensure the necessary security, the authors propose some potential solutions and recommendations. These include using a stronger source of randomness for generating nonces, performing additional tests on random number generators to uncover biases, and improving audibility and documentation in cryptographic libraries.\n\nOverall, this paper sheds light on an intriguing observation regarding the distribution of nonces in Bitcoin ECDSA signatures. By bringing attention to this matter, the authors aim to enhance the security practices within Bitcoin and potentially other cryptographic systems that rely on nonces.",

You can find the paper at the following URL: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/891.\n\nThe paper explores the relationship between block propagation speed and profitability for large miners in the context of cryptocurrencies. In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, miners play a crucial role in verifying and adding new transactions to the blockchain.\n\nBlock propagation refers to the process of distributing a newly created block to other miners in the network. When a miner successfully mines a new block, they want to propagate it as quickly as possible to other miners so that they can validate it and continue building on top of it.\n\nHowever, the authors investigate scenarios where slower block propagation might actually be more profitable for large miners. To understand this, we first need to delve into how mining rewards and mining competition work.\n\nIn cryptocurrency mining, miners compete with each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle successfully is rewarded with newly minted coins and any transaction fees associated with the block they have mined. This creates an incentive for miners to invest in powerful computing resources and compete to solve the puzzles faster than their competitors.\n\nLarge miners, with more computational power, typically have a higher chance of being the first to solve the puzzle and receive the mining rewards. However, in a network with fast block propagation, smaller miners also have a higher probability of mining a block that would propagate quickly and be validated by the network before a large miner's block reaches the network.\n\nThe key insight of the paper is that, in certain circumstances, larger miners may benefit from intentionally delaying the propagation of their blocks. By doing so, they increase the likelihood that their block will be validated by the network before a smaller miner's block reaches it.\n\nThis strategy can be profitable for large miners because they have a higher chance of mining a new block, and if their block is validated before a smaller miner's block is propagated, they can earn the mining rewards while the small miner's effort goes in vain.\n\nThe research paper likely presents a detailed analysis and provides mathematical models to explain the scenarios in which slower block propagation can be more profitable for large miners. It may discuss factors such as network latency, block size, and mining difficulty that affect block propagation speed and profitability.\n\nTo fully understand the findings and analysis presented in the paper, it would be best to read the paper itself, which is available at the mentioned URL. The paper may also provide important insights into the dynamics of cryptocurrency mining and how miners strategize to maximize their profits.",

Initially, the exploit caused a loss of $2.5 million, but now former users have been drained of approximately $1 million, bringing the total loss to $3.5 million.\n\nThe Atlantis Loans platform was abandoned by its developers in early April. Users were informed of this through a Medium post, in which the dev team stated that they could no longer afford to maintain the platform and believed discontinuing their services was in the best interest of users and the protection of their funds.\n\nDespite the abandonment, the protocol remained live, and the user interface (UI) was even paid up in advance for two years. However, any changes or actions on the platform had to be done through governance.\n\nOn April 12th, an attempted attack on Atlantis Loans took place, but it failed to pass. With the project abandoned, little attention was given to a proposal published on June 7th, known as proposal 52.\n\nThe attacker took advantage of the situation and pushed through the governance proposal, granting them control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts. They then upgraded the contracts with their own malicious contracts, allowing them to transfer tokens from any address that still had active approvals to the Atlantis contracts.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of how the attacker executed the proposal, you can refer to Numen Cyber's thread.

Lazarus Group linked to Atomic Wallet hack: The Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking group, has been connected to a recent hack on Atomic Wallet. The hackers stole over $35 million in cryptocurrency. Blockchain experts at Elliptic have been tracking the stolen funds and have attributed the attack to Lazarus based on their analysis of the funds' movements and laundering methods.\n\n11. Attribution of the hack to Lazarus Group: Elliptic's analysis points to Lazarus Group as the responsible threat actors behind the Atomic Wallet hack. They have a high level of confidence in this attribution based on the observed laundering strategy, the use of the Sinbad mixer, and the fact that the stolen cryptocurrency ended up in wallets associated with previous Lazarus hacks.\n\n12. Financial motivations and North Korea's weapons development: Experts believe that the Lazarus Group's monetary goals are directly used to fund North Korea's weapons development program. By successfully stealing cryptocurrency, the hackers acquire funds that can be used for illicit purposes.\n\n13. Challenges in cashing out stolen assets: The rise of blockchain monitoring firms and enhanced capabilities of law enforcement agencies have made it difficult for hackers to cash out stolen assets. As victims notify exchanges of the wallet addresses containing stolen funds, it becomes harder to exchange the stolen cryptocurrency for other forms of money. This causes hackers to turn to less reputable exchanges that take a commission to launder the money.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

The list combines information from the HackerOne leaderboard and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. The goal is to create a database similar to CVE but specific to the crypto community.\n\nThe author states that they welcome contributions to the list and encourage the crypto community to help crowdsource and expand the database. However, the author has set certain rules for inclusion in the list. Firstly, the vulnerability must have been discovered on the mainnet, which means that most audit findings are excluded. Secondly, the vulnerability must not have resulted in intentional loss of user funds, so most hacks reported on rekt.news are excluded.\n\nThe current sources for this list include postmortems from various security experts. However, the author invites additional submissions to fill in any gaps in the list.\n\nIt's important to note that this list only includes actual vulnerabilities and does not cover common weaknesses in code, which are covered by separate lists known as Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) lists. The author also clarifies that the list does not include black hat hacks that involve user loss of funds, even if the funds are eventually returned. There are other lists specifically for those types of incidents.\n\nWhile the focus of the list is on smart contract vulnerabilities, the author mentions that some layer 1 vulnerabilities may also be included. However, there are separate lists dedicated to layer 1 vulnerabilities.\n\nThe author emphasizes that contributions to the list are highly welcome and acknowledges that the list is likely incomplete.

      "summary": "The idea of conducting cryptanalysis using power LEDs stems from the fact that the intensity and color of these LEDs can provide valuable information about the cryptographic operations happening within a device. The power consumption of a device affects the intensity and brightness of its power LED, and since the power LED is directly connected to the power line of the electrical circuit, there is often a correlation between its brightness and the CPU operations.\n\nIn video-based cryptanalysis, attackers utilize video footage of the power LED obtained by commercial video cameras to analyze the variations in intensity or color. By detecting the beginning and end of cryptographic operations based on these variations, attackers can potentially recover secret keys from non-compromised devices.\n\nIt is important to note that the vulnerabilities exploited in this research are not in the power LEDs themselves but rather in the cryptographic libraries used in the devices. Power LEDs provide the infrastructure needed to visually exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate two specific attacks, namely HertzBleed and Minerva, to showcase the effectiveness of video-based cryptanalysis. These attacks were chosen because they both involve vulnerable cryptographic libraries and highlight that even recent cryptographic implementations may have vulnerabilities.\n\nTo prevent these attacks, the researchers recommend using the most updated cryptographic libraries available. However, they acknowledge that there is still a possibility of unknown vulnerabilities (0-day vulnerabilities) existing in the code of the most updated libraries. This uncertainty highlights the need for continuous security assessments and updates.\n\nThe vulnerability to video-based cryptanalysis extends to various devices. The researchers found that at least six smartcard readers from five different manufacturers, which are available for purchase on Amazon, are vulnerable to a direct attack. Furthermore, they also demonstrate an indirect attack on a Samsung Galaxy S8. It is possible that there are additional devices vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis, but this research specifically focuses on the mentioned devices.\n\nTo successfully conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs, attackers require video footage filled with the LED of the target device. This is because cryptanalysis necessitates a high sampling rate. By capturing video frames with the LED entirely filling the frame, attackers can exploit the rolling shutter effect of the camera to increase the number of measurements of the LED's color or intensity. This significantly enhances the sampling rate from the frames-per-second (FPS) rate to the rolling shutter's speed, providing the necessary sampling rate to attack devices such as smartphones, smartcards, and TV streamers.\n\nIf a device does not have a power LED integrated into it, it prevents attackers from directly recovering secret keys from the device's power LED. However, attackers may still be able to recover the secret key indirectly by analyzing video footage obtained from a power LED of a connected peripheral.\n\nThe concept of using power LEDs for cryptanalysis was conceived by the researchers as they explored the vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries. They recognized the potential of power LEDs to serve as a visual indicator of cryptographic operations and decided to investigate whether they could be exploited to recover secret keys. Through their research, they discovered the correlation between power consumption, power LED intensity/brightness, and the possibility of conducting cryptanalysis using video footage of power LEDs.",
      "summaryeli15": "A: The idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs came from the fact that the intensity or brightness of a device's power LED can correlate with its power consumption. In many electrical circuits, the power LED is directly connected to the power line of the circuit. This means that changes in the device's power consumption, such as those caused by CPU operations during cryptographic operations, can affect the intensity or brightness of the power LED.\n\nSo, the researchers realized that by recording video footage of the power LED using a commercial video camera, they could analyze the changes in intensity or color of the LED to detect the beginning and end of cryptographic operations. This information could potentially help them recover secret keys used in the encryption process.\n\nThe vulnerability is not actually in the power LEDs themselves, but rather in the cryptographic libraries used by the devices. The power LEDs simply provide a visual representation of the changes in power consumption during cryptographic operations, which can be exploited by attackers. The researchers chose to demonstrate two specific attacks, called HertzBleed and Minerva, to show that even recent cryptographic libraries can be vulnerable to this type of attack.\n\nTo prevent these attacks, the researchers recommend using the most updated cryptographic libraries available. However, they also caution that even the most updated libraries may still have undiscovered vulnerabilities, so there is always some level of risk. In terms of devices, at least six smartcard readers and the Samsung Galaxy S8 were found to be vulnerable, but there may be other devices that are also susceptible to video-based cryptanalysis.\n\nIn order to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs, attackers need to obtain video footage that captures the power LED of the target device. This is because cryptanalysis requires a high sampling rate, and by filling the frame with the LED, the rolling shutter of the video camera can capture the changes in intensity or color of the LED at a much faster rate than the typical frames per second (FPS) of the camera. For example, the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a rolling shutter speed of 60,000 measurements per second, compared to its FPS rate of 60 measurements per second. This high sampling rate allows attackers to collect the necessary data to attack devices such as smartphones, smartcards, and TV streamers.\n\nIf a device does not have a power LED, it cannot be directly attacked using this method. However, attackers may still be able to recover the secret key indirectly by using video footage obtained from the power LED of a connected peripheral device.\n\nOverall, the idea to use power LEDs for cryptanalysis came from the correlation between power consumption and LED intensity, and the researchers discovered that this information could be exploited to recover secret keys. It is important to keep cryptographic libraries updated to minimize the risk of these types of attacks. However, there is always the possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities, so it is important to remain cautious.",

      "summary": "Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe information provided describes a price manipulation exploit that resulted in the loss of approximately $800,000 for Sturdy Finance, an Ethereum-based lending protocol. The protocol offers leverage for yield farmers who deposit staked assets as collateral.\n\nThe attack on Sturdy Finance was similar to previous exploits on Midas Capital and dForce Network, and it involved the use of a flash loan. The attacker targeted the SturdyOracle, a component of the protocol, and manipulated the price of the collateral token called B-stETH-STABLE.\n\nThe attacker's address is listed as 0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b, and the attack contract used, which included front-running protection, is identified as 0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab. The attacker managed to profit 442 ETH, equivalent to $800,000, from this exploit.\n\nThe attacker then deposited the stolen funds into Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixer, which facilitated the laundering of the funds. This process was completed within just 20 minutes of the funds being obtained.\n\nThe vulnerability exploited in this attack is known as a read-only reentrancy vulnerability, which has been observed in various attacks over the past year. It allows an attacker to repeatedly call a function in a smart contract in a way that allows them to manipulate the behavior of the contract.\n\nInterestingly, a post on Balancer forums from February had previously highlighted the vulnerability in some Balancer pools as well. The specific pools targeted in the Sturdy Finance attack were also listed as vulnerable. Despite the existence of three audits conducted by Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena, which presumably aimed to identify such vulnerabilities, these pools were left exposed to attack.\n\nThe prevalence of these attacks and vulnerabilities has led to discussions about the need for oracle-free lending systems, as oracles are often vulnerable points of failure. However, it is acknowledged that even solutions without oracles may eventually require some form of oracle integration for their operation.\n\nThe article concludes by expressing hope for the improvement of security measures in future protocols, using the phrase \"building on Sturdy-er foundations\" as a metaphorical expression of the need for stronger security practices.\n\nThe information also mentions other recent attacks on cryptocurrency platforms. AlphaPo lost $60 million, EraLend lost $3.4 million, and Conic Finance lost a total of $4.2 million in a double blow. These incidents emphasize the ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities faced by protocols in the cryptosphere.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sturdy Finance, an Ethereum-based lending protocol, recently experienced a loss of around $800k due to a price manipulation exploit. The protocol allows yield farmers to deposit staked assets as collateral in order to leverage their yields. After the attack took place, the Sturdy Finance team acknowledged the exploit and paused all markets to prevent further funds from being at risk. They assured users that no additional actions were required at the moment.\n\nThe attack on Sturdy Finance used a flash loan to target the SturdyOracle, which unfortunately had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of the collateral token called B-stETH-STABLE. The attacker's address was identified as 0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b, and the attack contract with built-in front-running protection was located at 0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab. The attacker was able to make a profit of 442 ETH (equivalent to $800k) and quickly deposited it into Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixer, just 20 minutes after the initial funding.\n\nThis type of vulnerability, known as read-only reentrancy, has been observed in multiple attacks over the past year. In February, it was noted that certain Balancer pools were also susceptible to this attack vector, and in this particular incident, the targeted pools were identified as vulnerable. Despite the fact that Sturdy Finance had undergone three audits from reputable firms (Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena), it is surprising that these pools were still left open to such attacks. This has led to discussions about the need for oracle-free lending systems, although it is possible that some solutions may still require oracles.\n\nREKT, a public platform for anonymous authors, shared this information but does not take responsibility for the views or content hosted on its platform. They also provided a donation address for those who might want to contribute (ETH/ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C.\n\nIn addition to the incident at Sturdy Finance, there have been other notable losses in the cryptocurrency space. AlphaPo lost $60M, which didn't seem to surprise many due to previous stories of compromised hot wallets. However, it is clear that the Lazarus group, a notorious hacking group, remains active. EraLend also lost $3.4M to the read-only reentrancy bug that is affecting various protocols in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is worth noting that comments alone are not sufficient protection against this type of exploit. Furthermore, Conic Finance suffered a double blow, losing a total of $4.2M from their ETH and crvUSD omnipools on Friday. The survival of this promising protocol is now in question.\n\nOverall, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities in the cryptocurrency space, with exploitations occurring across various protocols and platforms. It emphasizes the need for stronger security measures and more robust auditing processes to protect users and their funds.",

      "summaryeli15": "This text is a comment left on a GitHub pull request, which is a request to merge changes into a software project. The comment provides an explanation of the changes made in the pull request in detail.\n\nThe pull request is related to the bootstrap mechanism of the software. When the software starts up, it needs to gather information about other peers on the network to establish connections with them. The current bootstrap mechanism involves using a set of fixed seeds, which are predefined addresses of known peers. However, the pull request aims to add an alternative bootstrap mechanism called \"seednode\".\n\nThe \"seednode\" mechanism works by connecting to a specific peer specified by the user, gathering addresses of other peers from that node, and then disconnecting from it. The idea is that if users specify a seednode, they prefer addresses from that node over the fixed seeds. \n\nHowever, there is a problem when the user disables the use of DNS seeds (which are another way of gathering peer addresses) and specifies a seednode. In this case, the software immediately removes the entry for the seednode from the list of addresses to fetch (m_addr_fetches) before the seednode could provide any addresses. As a result, the software falls back to using the fixed seeds, which can lead to a race between the fixed seeds and seednodes to fill up the address manager (AddrMan).\n\nTo address this issue, the pull request suggests a change to delay the querying of fixed seeds for 1 minute when the user specifies any seednode. This change involves checking for the presence of a specified seednode instead of relying on the size of m_addr_fetches. By doing this, the software gives the seednode a chance to provide addresses before falling back to the fixed seeds.\n\nThe pull request also mentions that the proposed change can be tested by running the software with certain command line arguments and observing the debug log.\n\nThe comment also includes some additional information for reviewers and maintainers, such as conflicts with other pull requests, a link to relevant documentation, and a request for feedback or questions about the project.\n\nOverall, the comment provides a detailed explanation of the changes made in the pull request and the reasoning behind them.

      "summaryeli15": "This is a conversation about a pull request on GitHub, where developers discuss changes to a codebase. The pull request is about removing a feature called \"mapRelay\" and replacing it with a new feature called \"m_most_recent_block_txs\". \n\nThe pull request states that the \"mapRelay\" feature has some issues and explains that it is used to relay announced transactions that are no longer in the mempool. The mempool is a data structure where unconfirmed transactions are stored before they get included in a block and added to the blockchain. \n\nThe pull request suggests that the main reason for relaying these transactions is when a peer has requested a transaction that is included in a block that the peer is about to receive. This can save time by delivering the transaction before the block arrives. \n\nThe pull request also mentions a possible improvement to the code by moving the \"mapRelay\" feature into the \"txmempool\" feature, which keeps track of the transactions in the mempool. This would allow for better management of the size of \"mapRelay\" and the mempool. \n\nThe conversation continues with discussions about the benefits and drawbacks of overlapping \"mapRelay\" with the mempool and the possibility of trimming \"mapRelay\" before the scheduled expiry time. There are concerns raised about how this could affect compact block relay and the potential for running out of memory or losing fee income. \n\nThe developers also discuss the need to relay replaced transactions and the privacy issues associated with it. They suggest using a reject filter for replaced transactions and continue serving transactions from \"vExtraTxnForCompact\" to address privacy concerns. \n\nThere is a mention of another pull request that addresses similar issues and comments on the relevance of a previous discussion thread. \n\nThe pull request is eventually updated with a test commit and the changes are pushed.

These templates enable users to create taproot descriptors using predefined structures.\n\nThe conversation also mentions the confusion regarding the Mainnet descriptor matching with a Regtest address. The reason for this confusion is that the first network is used to set the 2nd derivation index of Bipxx, while the second network is used for the address prefix. As a result, if someone tries to use the same Xpriv (extended private key) but builds with \"build(Network::Regtest)\" and derives the addresses, they will not match up with the test vector.\n\nTo resolve this confusion, there are two possible options discussed. The first option is to change the first network to \"regtest\" in the build call, while the second option is to change the second network to \"mainnet\".

In this PR, the first network is used to set the second derivation index of Bipxx, while the second network determines the address prefix.\n\nAt first, there may be some confusion as to why a Mainnet descriptor matches with a Regtest address. This is because the first network is only used for setting the derivation index and not for address generation.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously:\nThis statement indicates that the developers of the Bitcoin Rust library value user feedback and consider it important for improving the library's functionality and features.\n\n2. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation:\nIt suggests that the library provides a set of qualifiers that can be used for certain purposes. The documentation of the library contains more information on these qualifiers.\n\n3. Work fast with our official CLI. Learn more about the CLI:\nThe library provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to work efficiently and perform various tasks related to Bitcoin. Users can learn more about this CLI through additional documentation or resources provided.\n\n4. If nothing happens, download GitHub Desktop and try again:\nThis message suggests that if there is an issue with the provided CLI or any other tool, users can try downloading GitHub Desktop and attempting the task again.\n\n5. There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again:\nIn case users encounter difficulties in preparing their coding environment, this message advises them to attempt the process again.\n\n6. Library with support for de/serialization, parsing and executing on data-structures and network messages related to Bitcoin:\nThe Bitcoin Rust library offers essential functionality for handling data structures and network messages associated with Bitcoin. It supports tasks like de/serialization (conversion between data format and objects) and parsing these structures.\n\n7. For JSONRPC interaction with Bitcoin Core, it is recommended to use rust-bitcoincore-rpc:\nIf users intend to interact with Bitcoin Core using JSONRPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol, it is suggested to employ the rust-bitcoincore-rpc library for improved compatibility and functionality.\n\n8. It is recommended to always use cargo-crev to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one:\nIn order to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin Rust library and its dependencies, it is advised to utilize cargo-crev. This tool enables the authentication and verification of third-party code dependencies.\n\n9. This library must not be used for consensus code (i.e. fully validating blockchain data):\nWhile the library technically allows for validating blockchain data, it explicitly states that it should not be used for consensus code. It warns that there may be deviations between this library and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation, which could result in inconsistent data validation.\n\n10. Given the complexity of both C++ and Rust, it is unlikely that this will ever be fixed, and there are no plans to do so:\nThis statement implies that fixing the discrepancies between the Bitcoin Rust library and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation is unlikely, primarily due to the complexity of both the C++ and Rust programming languages. It further clarifies that there are no current plans to address this issue.\n\n11. 16-bit pointer sizes are not supported and we can't promise they will be:\nThe library does not currently support 16-bit pointer sizes. It also states that there is no commitment to adding support for this in the future.\n\n12. Currently can be found on docs.rs/bitcoin. Patches to add usage examples and to expand on existing docs would be extremely appreciated:\nThe Bitcoin Rust library's documentation is available on the docs.rs/bitcoin website. The developers encourage users to contribute by submitting patches that add usage examples or expand the existing documentation.\n\n13. Contributions are generally welcome. If you intend to make larger changes please discuss them in an issue before PRing them to avoid duplicate work and architectural mismatches:\nThe library welcomes contributions from the community. However, if users plan to make significant changes to the library's codebase, it is advisable to discuss these changes beforehand by creating an issue. This helps prevent duplicated efforts and ensures compatibility with the library's architecture.\n\n14. To build with the MSRV you will need to pin serde (if you have the feature enabled):\nWhen building the library with the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV), users are required to specify pinning the serde library if they have the relevant feature enabled.\n\n15. We integrate with a few external libraries, most notably serde. These are available via feature flags:\nThe Bitcoin Rust library incorporates several external libraries, with serde being a notable example. These libraries can be included or excluded depending on the feature flags specified during the build process.\n\n16. We do not provide any guarantees about the content of these lock files outside of \"our CI didn't fail with these versions\". Specifically, we do not guarantee that the committed hashes are free from malware. It is your responsibility to review them:\nWhile the library provides lock files containing information about compatible dependency versions, it does not guarantee the absence of malware in the committed hashes. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying the integrity of these lock files themselves.\n\n17. Rust can be installed using your package manager of choice or rustup.rs. The former way is considered more secure since it typically doesn't involve trust in the CA system:\nThis statement outlines two methods for installing Rust programming language: using a package manager or through rustup.rs. It suggests that the package manager approach is generally more secure as it reduces the reliance on trust within the Certificate Authority (CA) system.\n\n18. The cargo feature std is enabled by default. At least one of the features std or no-std or both must be enabled:\nThe library has a cargo feature named std, which is enabled by default. It indicates that either the std feature, the no-std feature, or both must be enabled when building the library.\n\n19. The CI pipeline requires approval before being run on each MR:\nBefore running the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for each Merge Request (MR), approval from the relevant parties is required to ensure the correctness and integrity of the proposed changes.\n\n20. Since the altcoin landscape includes projects which frequently appear and disappear, and are poorly designed anyway we do not support any altcoins:\nThe Bitcoin Rust library explicitly states that it does not offer support for any alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) due to the lack of stability and the poor design quality often associated with such projects.\n\n21.

However, it clarifies that the content of these lock files is not guaranteed to be free from malware, and users should review them themselves.\n\nThe paragraph then provides instructions on how to install Rust using a package manager or rustup.rs, mentioning that the former way is considered more secure due to not relying on the Certificate Authority (CA) system, but cautioning that the version of Rust provided by the distribution might be outdated.\n\nThe next sentence explains that the cargo feature std is enabled by default and at least one of the features std or no-std must be enabled. It clarifies that enabling the no-std feature does not disable std and that to disable the std feature, the default features must be disabled. It also mentions that both features can be enabled without conflict.\n\nThe paragraph advises users to refer to the cargo documentation for more detailed instructions.\n\nThe next paragraph mentions that the library's documentation is built using the nightly toolchain of Rust. It provides a shell alias that can be used to check if documentation changes build correctly.\n\nThe following paragraph informs that unit and integration tests, as well as benchmarks, are available. It encourages project developers and new contributors to contribute to the testing efforts and considers testing code as a first-class citizen.\n\nThe paragraph suggests running cargo test --all-features to run tests for the library.\n\nThe next sentence explains that a custom Rust compiler configuration is used to guard benchmark code, and to run the benchmarks, the user should use RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=bench' cargo +nightly bench.\n\nThe paragraph then mentions mutation testing with mutagen and provides instructions for installation. It also mentions using kani for testing and provides installation and running instructions.\n\nThe next paragraph states that every pull request needs at least two reviews to be merged. It also mentions that maintainers and contributors may leave comments and request changes during the review phase, and it is important to address them. Otherwise, if there is a long period of inactivity, the pull request may be closed without merging. It suggests marking a work-in-progress pull request with \"WIP: \" in the title if it is not ready for review yet.\n\nThe following sentence states that the CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline requires approval before being run on each merge request.\n\nThe paragraph then explains that the CI pipeline can be run locally using a tool called act to speed up the review process.

      "summaryeli15": "This pull request is about exposing a functionality called \"signature verification\" for ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures on the `PublicKey` type, which is a type used in a programming library called `rust-bitcoin`. \n\nThe purpose of this functionality is to allow for the verification of signatures, which are used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. By verifying a signature, you can confirm that the data has not been tampered with and that it was indeed signed by the owner of the corresponding public key.\n\nThe pull request suggests adding this functionality to the `PublicKey` type, which is a type used in the library. However, it also mentions that an identical function should be added to the `XOnlyPublicKey` type. The reason for this is that the `XOnlyPublicKey` functionality is specific to a different cryptographic algorithm called `secp256k1`, which is not the same as the one currently used in the library (`secp2561`).\n\nTo implement this functionality, changes need to be made in the `rust-secp256k1` library, specifically in the file `rust-secp256k1#618`. The purpose of this file is to handle the ECDSA signature verification for the `secp256k1` algorithm.\n\nBy merging this pull request, the suggested changes will be made in the library, and any related issues or questions will be resolved.

      "summaryeli15": "This document provides detailed information about an optimized C library for EC operations on the curve secp256k1. This library is designed to efficiently perform cryptographic operations on this specific curve. It is considered the highest quality publicly available library for secp256k1 cryptography, although its development has primarily focused on its usage in the Bitcoin system. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this library may not have been extensively tested or verified for other use cases outside of Bitcoin. Therefore, if you intend to use it for non-Bitcoin purposes, you need to exercise caution and ensure that the library is suitable for your application's requirements.\n\nTo compile optional modules, such as Schnorr signatures, you need to use specific commands or flags during the compilation process. For example, if you want to enable the Schnorr signatures module, you need to run \"./configure\" with the \"--enable-module-schnorrsig\" flag. The available flags can be viewed by running \"./configure --help\" to see the full list.\n\nTo maintain a clean source tree during the build process, CMake recommends performing an out-of-source build. This means that you should create a separate dedicated build tree and run the build commands from there.\n\nDepending on your target platform, there are different instructions for compiling optional modules or cross-compiling. For example, if you want to cross-compile for Windows, you can use preconfigured toolchain files provided in the \"cmake\" directory. The document provides an example of cross-compiling for Android using the Android NDK and assumes that the \"ANDROID_NDK_ROOT\" environment variable has been set.\n\nIf you're building on Windows with Visual Studio, you need to specify the appropriate generator for a new build tree. The document provides an example assuming the use of Visual Studio 2022 and CMake v3.21+.\n\nUsage examples for this library can be found in the \"examples\" directory. To compile these examples, you need to configure the library with the \"--enable-examples\" flag. Additionally, to compile the Schnorr signature and ECDH examples, you also need to enable the corresponding modules during configuration.\n\nThe library aims to have full coverage of the reachable lines and branches, meaning that the test suite should cover all possible code paths. If you want to generate a test coverage report, you can enable it during configuration using the \"--enable-coverage\" flag. Note that using GCC is necessary for generating the report.\n\nTo create a coverage report, the document recommends using the \"gcovr\" tool, which not only provides coverage statistics but also includes branch coverage reporting. The document provides an example command for creating an HTML report with colored and annotated source code.\n\nIf you have enabled benchmarking during configuration (which is the default behavior), the build process will generate binaries for benchmarking the library's functions. These binaries will be present in the root directory after the build.\n\nLastly, the document provides a series of commands for different build scenarios, such as building with autotools, CMake, cross-compiling, and coverage reporting.\n\nOverall, this document provides comprehensive information about how to work with the optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1, from compiling optional modules to running tests and generating coverage reports.",

      "summary": "Core Lightning is a Lightning Network implementation that is designed to be lightweight, customizable, and compliant with the Lightning Network protocol. It has been used in production on the Bitcoin mainnet since early 2018 and is considered stable and safe to use.\n\nThe implementation can be tested and experimented with on the testnet or regtest before using it on the mainnet. The developers of Core Lightning actively encourage users to provide feedback, report bugs, and help resolve any outstanding issues.\n\nTo get started with Core Lightning, you need to have Linux or macOS and a locally or remotely running bitcoind (Bitcoin Core) version 0.16 or above. The bitcoind should be fully synchronized with the network you're running on and should relay transactions.\n\nCore Lightning also supports pruning, but with some limitations. Pruning allows you to reduce the disk space consumed by the blockchain data. You can find more details about pruning in the provided documentation.\n\nIf you want to experiment with lightningd (the Lightning Network daemon), there is a script available to set up a regtest test network with two local lightning nodes. This script provides a convenient helper called start_ln. The details on how to use this script are mentioned in the comments at the top of the startup_regtest.sh file.\n\nNote that if you have enabled developer options on your node, your local nodeset will be faster and more responsive.\n\nTo test with real Bitcoin, you need to have a local bitcoind node running. You should wait until bitcoind has synchronized with the network. Make sure that you do not have walletbroadcast=0 in your bitcoin.conf file, as it may cause issues. Running Core Lightning against a pruned node may also cause some issues if not managed carefully.\n\nOnce you have set up everything correctly, you can start lightningd with a command that creates a .lightning/ subdirectory in your home directory. You can find more runtime options in the man page or the provided online documentation.\n\nCore Lightning exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. You can use the lightning-cli tool or a Python client library to access this interface. The lightning-cli tool provides a table of RPC methods, and you can use thunder-cli help for specific information on a command.\n\nThere are numerous plugins available for Core Lightning that add additional capabilities. You can find a collection of plugins on GitHub, including helpme, which guides you through setting up channels and customizing your node.\n\nFor a safer experience, you can encrypt the HD wallet seed using the provided instructions for HD wallet encryption.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, you can join the #c-lightning IRC channel on libera.chat or chat with other users. The community is always happy to assist you.\n\nTo open a channel on the Lightning Network, you first need to transfer some funds to lightningd. Once the transaction is confirmed, lightningd will register the funds. If the faucet you are using does not support bech32 addresses, you may need to generate a P2SH-segwit address.\n\nAfter having funds in lightningd, you can connect to a remote node and open a channel. You need to provide the IP address or domain and the node ID of the remote node. The funding transaction requires a certain number of confirmations to be usable and announced. You can check the status of the channel using lightning-cli listpeers and lightning-cli listchannels.\n\nPayments in the Lightning Network are based on invoices. The recipient creates an invoice with the expected amount to be paid in millisatoshi or \"any\" for a donation. The payer uses the bolt11 string provided in the invoice to decode and pay it using lightning-cli commands.\n\nCore Lightning can be configured either via command line options or a configuration file. Command line options always override the values in the configuration file. A sample configuration file is available for reference.\n\nIf you are a developer wishing to contribute to Core Lightning, you should start with the provided developer guide. Enabling the developer options during configuration will provide additional checks and options.\n\nThe given code snippets at the end of the text provide examples of commands to interact with Core Lightning, such as connecting to nodes, funding a channel, creating an invoice, and making a payment.",

It has been used on the Bitcoin mainnet since 2018 and is considered stable for use in production environments. However, it is recommended to experiment with Core Lightning on a test network before using it on the mainnet.\n\nThe development team behind Core Lightning values user feedback and takes it seriously. They encourage users to test the implementation, report bugs, and contribute to resolving any outstanding issues. Users can reach out to the team through various channels such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, and Telegram.\n\nCore Lightning is compatible with Linux and macOS operating systems. It requires a locally or remotely running bitcoind, a Bitcoin node software, that is fully synchronized with the network. The implementation also relies on bitcoind to relay transactions. Core Lightning partially supports pruning, a mechanism to reduce the storage requirements of the Bitcoin node.\n\nTo set up a test network using Core Lightning, there is a script available that helps in configuring two local lightning nodes connected to a bitcoind regtest network. This script provides a convenient starting point for experimenting with lightningd, the Lightning Network daemon.\n\nOnce lightningd is set up, it exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. Users can interact with lightningd using the lightning-cli tool or a Python client library. The available methods and commands can be explored using the lightning-cli help command.\n\nThe implementation also supports various plugins that add additional functionalities to Core Lightning. These plugins can be found on the official GitHub repository of Core Lightning.\n\nTo use Core Lightning, users need to transfer funds to lightningd to open a channel. This can be done by generating a payment address and sending funds to it. Once lightningd receives the funds, it can connect to another Lightning Network node and open a channel with it. Channels require a certain number of confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain to become usable and publicly announced.\n\nPayments in the Lightning Network are invoice-based. The recipient generates an invoice specifying the expected amount and other details. The sender can pay the invoice using lightning-cli commands, such as decodepay and pay.\n\nConfiguration of lightningd can be done via command line options or a configuration file. Command line options take precedence over the values in the configuration file. A sample configuration file is provided, and there are options to encrypt sensitive information in the configuration.\n\nDevelopers interested in contributing to Core Lightning can refer to the developer guide. Enabling developer options during configuration provides additional checks and options for development purposes.\n\nTo set up and use Core Lightning, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Run the script contrib/startup_regtest.sh to set up a bitcoind regtest network.\n2. Configure Core Lightning with the --enable-developer option during the configure step.\n3. Start bitcoind in daemon mode.\n4. Start lightningd with the --network=bitcoin and --log-level=debug options.\n5. Use the lightning-cli tool to perform various operations, such as generating addresses, connecting to nodes, opening channels, creating invoices, and making payments.",

      "summary": "This passage discusses a proposed change in the core lightning software. Currently, when core lightning requests information about the blockchain using the \"getchaininfo\" command, it already knows the minimum and maximum block height. However, there is an issue when a smarter Bitcoin backend is used that is capable of switching between different clients. In these cases, it would be helpful for lightningd (the core lightning daemon) to provide information about the current known height and pass it down to the plugin.\n\nThe purpose of this change is to allow the plugin to have the correct known height from lightningd and fix any problems that may exist. This is particularly useful when syncing a new backend from scratch, such as the \"nakamoto\" backend. By providing this information, the plugin can start syncing the chain and only return an answer when it is in sync with the current status of lightningd. This helps avoid returning a lower height from the known and prevents crashes in core lightning.\n\nThe passage also mentions that this change is necessary because Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, is slow to sync up. Therefore, waiting for Bitcoin Core to catch up may not be a viable solution. The time it takes for Bitcoin Core to sync up depends on various factors. By informing the plugin about the height, it allows for the possibility of starting the syncing process and then moving the execution to another backend until the previous one is ready.\n\nThe goal of this change is to ensure that there is no ambiguity or lack of information when running the \"getchaininfo\" command. It provides the opportunity to wait for the blockchain sync or decide to dispatch the request elsewhere. The passage explicitly states that the author is open to working on a solution within core lightning if it is deemed more appropriate.\n\nThe passage also mentions that there have been minor changes in the implementation and suggests updating the documentation to mention the new parameter. Finally, it states that the proposed change is built on top of an RFC (Request for Comments) from the core lightning project, with the author's signing-off.\n\nIn summary, this passage describes a proposed change in the core lightning software to pass the current known block height down to the \"getchaininfo\" call.

The documentation provides an example of the minimal bitcoin.conf file you should use, but depending on your hardware configuration, you may need to adjust the values of certain parameters for faster verification and better handling of API requests.\n\nIf you encounter Java heap size errors, you can increase the maximum memory allocated to the JVM using the -Xmx parameter. However, this is usually not necessary for most users.\n\nIf you want to run multiple instances of Eclair on the same machine, it is mandatory to use a separate data directory for each instance. You also need to change the ports in the eclair.conf file accordingly.\n\nEclair uses logback for logging, and you can use a custom logback.xml configuration file if you want to override the default logging configuration.\n\nIt's important to back up your Bitcoin Core wallet file and regularly back up the Eclair data directory. The Eclair database snapshot, named eclair.sqlite.bak, should be backed up regularly. You can use scripts to automate the backup process and ensure the safety of your data.\n\nIf you want to run Eclair in a Docker container, Docker images are available for x86_64 and arm64 platforms. You can use the JAVA_OPTS environment variable to set arguments to the Eclair node. If you want to persist the data directory, you can use the -v argument when running the Docker container.\n\nEclair also supports plugins written in Scala, Java, or any JVM-compatible language. These plugins need to implement the Plugin interface and have a manifest entry specifying the implementation class.\n\nBy default, Eclair is configured to run on the mainnet, but you can also run it on testnet, regtest, or signet. To do this, you need to modify the eclair.conf file and specify the appropriate Bitcoin node configuration.\n\nOverall, Eclair is a powerful Scala implementation of the Lightning Network that can be integrated into applications using its feature-rich HTTP API. It relies on Bitcoin Core to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain and has specific configuration and backup requirements to ensure the security and proper functioning of the node.",

      "summaryeli15": "In this message, there are several discussions happening about a Pull Request (PR) on a coding platform like GitHub. Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. Reading Feedback: The developers are saying that they read and carefully consider all the feedback they receive from users like you.\n\n2. Documentation: They mention that the available qualifiers (which I assume are some sort of specifications or features) can be found in their documentation. So, if you have any questions about these qualifiers, you can refer to their documentation to find out more.\n\n3. Have a Question or Issue: If you have any questions or problems regarding this project, they suggest signing up for a free GitHub account and using it to open an issue or contact the maintainers and the community. GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate and work on code together.\n\n4. Rationale for the PR: The authors are explaining the reason behind this particular PR. They want to avoid a situation where the routing fees exceed the maximum fee allowed. This PR allows a new feature to set the maxFeeMsat (maximum fee in milli-satoshis) for a particular RPC (Remote Procedure Call) called sendtoroute. If the routing fees go above this maximum fee, the software will return an error instead of continuing with the transaction.\n\n5. Release Notes: The developers ask the person responsible for the PR to update the release notes accordingly. Release notes are documents where changes made in a particular version of a software or project are recorded and explained.\n\n6. Merging PR: The authors mention that if this PR is merged (incorporated) into the main/master branch, it will decrease the code coverage (a measure of how much code is tested by automated tests) by 0.03%. They also mention the specific versions of the code that are being compared.\n\n7. GitHub App Integration: The developers inform their organization that they are not using the GitHub App Integration and that it may result in a degraded service starting from May 15th. They recommend installing the GitHub App Integration for their organization for better service and explain where to read more about it.\n\n8. Closing Issues: They state that merging this PR might close some issues. In the context of software development, issues can refer to bug reports, feature requests, or other tasks that need to be addressed.\n\n9. API Changes: This part lists various changes made to the application programming interface (API) of the software. These changes include new features, updates to existing ones, and changes in the behavior of certain commands or functions. The changes are described briefly, and each change is accompanied by its corresponding issue number for reference.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the message better! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

      "summary": "This passage is discussing a pull request (PR) in the context of a software development project. The PR is proposing a change that will allow users to access historic channel data without relying on third-party services. The API being discussed is strictly for managing a user's node, and the goal is to avoid maintaining too many unused APIs.\n\nThe passage mentions that this PR will make the submitter famous, albeit in a humorous way. It is also mentioned that the proposed change will provide more control over the node to the users and help retain their privacy.\n\nThere is a mention of accessing the database directly, which seems to be a suggestion made in the past. However, there are apparent problems with this approach, although the specific problems are not mentioned.\n\nThe passage also mentions the existence of code and data and states that just a few lines of code are needed to combine them.\n\nThe user expresses an interest in knowing what happened with their own money and states that it is an essential part of managing their node.\n\nThere is a suggestion to add pagination and make the count parameter mandatory for listing closed channels, as the list will eventually become very large.\n\nThe passage mentions a merge of a specific commit into the master branch, which will increase code coverage by 0.00%. The coverage details are provided, showing the percentage of code lines covered by tests.\n\nThere is a message about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration and a warning about degraded service starting from May 15th.\n\nThere is a suggestion to optimize the performance of nodes with a large amount of historical data by moving closed channels to their own table.\n\nThe passage mentions that the changes in the DB files look good except for a few comments.\n\nThere is a mention of successfully merging the pull request and a link to a website that presumably discusses the accomplishment.\n\nLastly, there is a mention of API changes in a new release, listing the specific changes and improvements made to different API endpoints.",
      "summaryeli15": "This pull request (PR) is proposing some changes to the code. It aims to allow users to access historic channel data without relying on third-party services. This means that users can retrieve information about their own node and its activities without needing to use external tools.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the API being discussed here is specifically for managing your own node. The developers are not interested in creating too many APIs that may not be widely used. They want to focus on providing essential functionality for node operators.\n\nOne important aspect of this PR is that it will provide more control over the node to the users. They can access the historic channel data, which can be useful for managing and analyzing their node's activities. Additionally, this feature also helps to protect users' privacy as they won't have to rely on third-party services for this information.\n\nThe PR mentions that it has been recognized by the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter, which is a well-known publication in the Bitcoin community. This recognition can potentially bring more attention and recognition to the developer of this PR.\n\nThe developers make it clear that the API is strictly for managing the node and not for performing exotic use-cases or analysis. If users have specific use-cases or want to perform detailed analysis, they are encouraged to run those directly on the database, preferably the read-only replicated database to avoid impacting the running node.\n\nThe developer of this PR argues that it is essential for users to have access to this historic channel data. They believe that knowing what happened with their own money is a crucial part of managing their node. They also mention that the code and data needed for this functionality already exist, and it will only require a few lines of code to create a solution.\n\nThe developer brings up the issue of accessing the database directly, which has been mentioned before. They acknowledge that there are some problems with this approach. One problem is that the JSON format of the database is not documented, but users can use their intelligence to figure out its structure.\n\nThe developer mentions that they use Python for their small automation scripts and asks how they can write a script that tells whether a channel has been force closed or not using this data. They are interested in understanding how to utilize this data to perform specific tasks with their Python scripts.\n\nThere is also a discussion about the list of closed channels and the potential issue of having a large list. It is suggested that instead of listing everything at once, pagination should be implemented with a mandatory count parameter. This will help avoid issues with performance for nodes that have a lot of historical data.\n\nAt one point, it is stated that merging this PR will increase the code coverage by 0.00%. This means that the proposed changes will not impact the overall code coverage significantly.\n\nLastly, there are references to other issues and updates related to the project, such as API changes, websocket events, and new functionalities that have been introduced in previous releases.\n\nIn summary, this PR proposes changes that will allow users to access historic channel data for better control over their nodes and increased privacy. It addresses the need for managing and analyzing node activities without relying on third-party services. The PR also mentions the recognition it has received and discusses various technical details and considerations related to implementing this feature.",

The author of this comment found the project more complex than expected and suggested simplifications and refactorings in pull request #2663. They state that they are getting closer to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release.\n8. The author mentioned that they merged improvements but kept a separate routing algorithm for messages and payments since they are too different to be solved by the same algorithm. They consider separating them easier than making something generic.\n9. Dijkstra algorithm is now used for both message and payment routing. The author explains that they can prioritize big channels, old channels, and penalize disabled edges while still considering them. They had to rebase their code to fix a conflict.\n10. The author expressed concerns about potential performance regressions in the code and deems it critical. They suggest not including the code changes in the release and instead spending time testing it on their node before merging it into the master branch.\n11. The author mentions some timing differences in specific operations like DirectedGraph.makeGraph, .addEdges, and yenKshortestPaths. They explain the changes in execution time compared to earlier versions.\n12. The author suggests that writing specialized code for DirectedGraph.makeGraph may not be worth it since it is only called once at startup. They note that storing edges in a map instead of a list has trade-offs: a 10% increase in path-finding time but a 10x improvement in update time.\n13.

By signing up for a GitHub account, the user agrees to the terms of service and privacy statement. The comment also mentions that starting from May 15th, there might be a degradation in the service if the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration, and it recommends installing the GitHub App Integration.\n\nThe third comment is about a new feature that has been added to the project. It explains that now, when the postman (a metaphorical term for a messenger in this context) sends a message, they can ask the router to find a route using channels only. This route is also used as a reply path if applicable.\n\nThe fourth comment is about merging a particular commit into the main branch of the project.

It recommends installing the GitHub App Integration to avoid this issue and provides a link to read more information about it.\n\nThe sixth comment expresses that the task at hand has turned out to be more complex than expected. The person making the comment proposes some simplifications and refactorings in a separate commit and mentions that they are getting closer to releasing a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nThe seventh comment acknowledges the improvements made by someone else, but states that they have kept a separate routing algorithm for messages and payments. The person making the comment explains that routing messages is too different from routing payments, so it is simpler to separate the two rather than trying to create a generic solution.\n\nThe eighth comment states that Dijkstra's algorithm is now being used for message routing as well. It explains that the algorithm can prioritize big channels and old channels, and penalize disabled edges, while still considering them if necessary. It also mentions that there was a conflict during the process of merging and that it has been fixed by rebasing on the main branch.\n\nThe ninth comment expresses that the person believes the changes made look good, but they are unsure about potential performance regressions. They also mention that this component is critical, so they suggest not including it in the current release. Instead, they propose spending time testing it on their node before releasing it. They plan to make the release first and then merge this specific commit to the main branch right after the release and after conducting performance benchmarks.\n\nThe tenth comment provides some performance metrics comparing the current code with the previous version. It states that certain functions now take more time to execute, while others take less time. It specifies the exact time differences and the corresponding speed increases or decreases.\n\nThe eleventh comment expresses the opinion that writing custom code for the DirectGraph.makeGraph function might not be worth it, as it is only called once at startup. It mentions that storing edges in a map instead of a list has some trade-offs, as it increases the time for path finding by 10% but significantly improves the update process by 10 times.\n\nThe twelfth comment acknowledges that the code is looking good and praises the work done. The person making the comment mentions that they will spend more time on the benchmarks and report their findings early next week.\n\nThe thirteenth comment hints that successfully merging this pull request could close some related issues.\n\nThe final comment shows the code coverage difference between the main branch and the current commit being discussed.

The library is an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol and can be used to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe library's primary crate, lightning, is designed to be runtime-agnostic, meaning it can work with different runtime environments. It supports data persistence, chain interactions, and networking, which can be provided by either LDK's sample modules or custom implementations by the user. More details about how to use these features can be found in the library's documentation.\n\nThe project claims to have implemented all of the BOLT specifications, which are the specifications for the Lightning Network protocol. It has been in production use since 2021, indicating that it is considered stable and reliable. However, since the Lightning Network involves financial transactions, the developers emphasize the importance of careful and attentive deployment to ensure safety.\n\nCommunication related to rust-lightning and the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) happens through LDK Discord channels, where users and developers can discuss and seek support for their projects.\n\nThe library provides a sample node implementation that can fetch blockchain data and manage on-chain funds using the Bitcoin Core RPC/REST interface. This demo is composed of different modular pieces, allowing users to pick and choose the functionalities they need and replace the rest with their own custom implementations.\n\nWhile rust-lightning does not provide certain features, such as data encryption, channel factories, or path finding, LDK offers implementations for these features. The goal of LDK is to provide a fully-featured and flexible Lightning implementation that allows users to decide how they want to use it. The library exposes its functionalities through simple and composable APIs, making it easier for developers to integrate it into their projects.\n\nThe developers request caution when adding new dependencies to the library, especially non-optional ones, as it can potentially introduce security risks or unnecessary complexity. They discourage adding dependencies with their own dependencies and suggest reducing the dependency usage in the rust-bitcoin crate.\n\nIt is worth noting that rust-lightning refers specifically to the core lightning crate within the repository, while LDK encompasses all the sample modules, language bindings, node implementations, and other tools built around rust-lightning.\n\nContributors are welcome to participate in the project, and guidelines for contribution can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\n\nFor an overview of the rust-lightning high-level API, the ARCH.md file provides an introduction.\n\nThe library is released under either the Apache-2.0 or MIT license, giving users the option to choose between the two licenses.\n\nLastly, the text advises running all tests before testing more esoteric flags in continuous integration, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing.",

The next part talks about signing up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and the community.\n\n3. A question is raised about the project structure. The current structure combines funded and unfunded channels into a single `Channel` struct, which can cause confusion and make it harder to work with the different states. The suggestion is to have three separate maps for channels in the `ChannelManager`, rather than using an enum to represent the different channel kinds.\n\n4. There is a suggestion to split the code changes into smaller commits for easier review and understanding. The suggested approach is to first create the context object in a regular channel, then add the trait, and finally split or refactor the code as necessary.\n\n5. The need for coordination to land the changes is mentioned. It is suggested to get some concept ACKs (acknowledgements) and have everyone online at the same time for a couple of hours to get the changes merged.\n\n6. The question about dropping the `ChannelKind` enum and using three separate maps for channels is repeated.\n\n7. The response explains that initially, the code was structured with the separate maps, but it became more complicated when dealing with a second map while in the process of handling an `OccupiedEntry`. However, the suggestion to split the code as previously mentioned is accepted, and different patterns will be tried to avoid using `RefCell`.\n\n8. There is confusion about the appearance of interior mutability, and it is clarified that it occurs in methods where context is accessed via a getter (`self.get_context()`) in the trait, but it is suggested to pass `&mut self` instead of using the getter.\n\n9. The author promises to push up some changes in the morning to address the issues and provide a better explanation.\n\n10. There is a request for an explanation of why the current design is still the right choice for dual-funding. The suggestion is to rename the structs from \"inbound/outbound\" to \"InitiatorChannel/InitiateeChannel\" and to consider having the same `PreFundingChannel` for both initiator and initiatee sides. The concern is whether there is enough functionality overlap between the two sides to justify having different structs.\n\n11. The response acknowledges that the refactoring of channels is trickier than anticipated.\n\n12. The suggestion is made to split the process into three stages: pre-funding stage with temporary channel IDs, post-funding stage where channel IDs exist but are not yet ready, and the operation stage where a channel is ready. However, it is mentioned that this split will be addressed in a future pull request, not in the current one.\n\n13. The suggestion to revert the change and keep `OutboundV1Channel::funding_signed` on `Channel::funding_signed` is discussed, with the agreement that it should be reverted to maintain consistency between `temp_chan_id` and `chan_id` in the maps. The need for an extra state is acknowledged, and it is suggested to handle it in a further pull request.\n\n14. The request is made to open a follow-up issue to track the necessary changes and address the comments provided by the reviewers.\n\n15. Some minor suggestions and changes are pointed out, such as using a doc comment instead of a regular comment, reducing unnecessary changesets, and removing redundant code.\n\n16. The suggestion is made to track all follow-up items in an issue to ensure they are not forgotten and to determine which changes should be included in the current release.\n\n17. Some specific code suggestions are made, such as merging certain code paths, updating where the maps are accessed, and improving the structure of the code for closing channels.\n\n18. The pull request is considered ready for merging, despite a few remaining issues that can be addressed in future follow-up commits. The suggestion to create a follow-up issue is reiterated to track the necessary changes and ensure they are resolved before the next release.\n\n19. The suggestion to address the warn/ignore cases properly is noted, and the need to move certain methods into the normal channel structure is also mentioned.\n\n20. The commit is reviewed again, and it is determined that it is ready to be merged, despite the need for additional clean-up and optimization in future commits.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this conversation, a group of people are discussing a project related to channels. The conversation is quite technical and uses terminology specific to the project. Here's a breakdown of the conversation:\n\n1. The first message states that every piece of feedback is read and taken seriously. It also mentions that there is documentation available to see all available qualifiers.\n2. The next message suggests signing up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers of the project.\n3. After that, there is a question about the structure of channels in the project. Currently, funded and unfunded channels are represented by a single `Channel` struct, which the person finds confusing and unsafe to use. They wonder if it would make more sense to have three separate maps for channels in the `ChannelManager` instead of using an enum.\n4. The following message suggests splitting the project into multiple commits for easier review and proposes a potential order for the commits.\n5. The conversation continues, discussing the need to coordinate the landing of the changes due to potential conflicts and the suggestion to get concept ACKs (acknowledgments) before proceeding.\n6. The original question about dropping the `ChannelKind` enum is addressed again, and the person shares their initial approach and concerns.\n7. The person mentions that they will follow the suggestion to split the project into multiple commits and shares their plan for resolving some code issues related to the `ChannelContext`.\n8. There is a discussion about why interior mutability is causing problems and the need to investigate the code to understand the issue better.\n9. The conversation shifts to discussing the design in dual-funding and whether it would make sense to have separate structs for initiator and initiatee channels. The potential naming change of the structs is also mentioned.\n10. The person acknowledges the complexity of the channel refactoring and discusses the pros and cons of different approaches to represent channels.\n11. A suggestion is made to have a single struct for pre-funded channels and track the initiator information in the context of another struct. However, it is noted that methods involving accept/open are different and having type-safety around them in the form of different structs would be beneficial.\n12. The conversation returns to the discussion of dropping the `ChannelKind` enum and the preference of having three separate maps for channels. The person agrees with the suggestion to split the project into smaller commits for better review.\n13. The person mentions the progress of their work, including deduplicating code and resolving borrow conflicts. They also realize that generalizing certain aspects of the code might not be necessary.\n14. An apology is made for potentially missing some feedback and a request is made for the reviewers to point out any important issues that may have been overlooked.\n15. One of the reviewers highlights unnecessary code changes and suggests reducing them.\n16. The unnecessary code changes are acknowledged, and the person agrees to remove them.\n17. Another comment is made about unnecessary code changes and suggests documenting the issues.\n18. The person acknowledges the suggestion to document the issues and promises to address them in a follow-up.\n19. A suggestion is made to improve the design of channels in the future, but it is determined that it won't be part of this project. The idea is to have three stages (pre-funding, post-funding, and operation) to enforce proper handling of channels.\n20. The need for a follow-up to address the issues and comments raised by the reviewers is emphasized. The person is requested to open an issue to track the follow-up work.\n21. The person agrees to address the issues in a follow-up and thanks the reviewers for their feedback.\n22. The reviewer suggests a change to improve code readability and reduce redundancy.\n23. The suggested change is acknowledged, and the person agrees to make the adjustment.\n24. There is a discussion about the positioning of code and the decision to keep it as is for the sake of readability in the current diff. The possibility of removing the code in a follow-up is mentioned.\n25. The reviewer suggests reducing code changes to use `self` instead of `channel_by_id`.\n26. The person acknowledges the suggestion and agrees to make the change.\n27. The reviewer suggests converting a comment into a documentation comment.\n28. The unnecessary match statement is acknowledged, and the person agrees to remove it.\n29. The person acknowledges the unnecessary code change and explains it was added and removed due to the project's structure.\n30. The reviewer suggests opening a follow-up issue to track the comments and issues raised during the review.\n31. The person agrees to open a follow-up issue and mentions that there will be further splitting of the code in the future.\n32. The latest commits are reviewed and deemed ready to be merged. The reviewer suggests addressing the bugs raised in the review before the next release.\n33. The person agrees with the suggestion and confirms that the bugs will be addressed in a follow-up.\n34. The reviewer points out a potential issue with handling warnings and suggests fixing it in a follow-up.\n35. The person agrees to fix the issue in a follow-up and mentions the possibility of improving code organization in the future.\n36. The reviewer suggests moving a method into the normal channel structure in the future for clarity.\n37. The person acknowledges the suggestion and agrees to make the improvement in the future.\n38. The reviewer wonders if a `DiscardFunding` event should be triggered in a specific code section.\n39. The person confirms that a `DiscardFunding` event should be triggered and mentions the complexity of the different code paths for closing channels.\n40. The reviewer observes that the code for handling HTLC updates and commitment signing is duplicated in different places and suggests unifying the code paths for closing channels.\n41. The person agrees with the suggestion and acknowledges the opportunity to improve code organization.\n42. The reviewer suggests removing the `available_channel_pubkeys` method and inlining its functionality in the callsite or using `list_channels` instead.\n43. The person acknowledges the suggestion and agrees to make the change.\n44. The reviewer gives a final approval to merge the pull request but highlights the need to address the remaining issues and comments in a follow-up and track them in an issue.\n45.

      "summary": "The passage you provided is a collection of comments and code snippets from a GitHub pull request. It appears to be a discussion and implementation of a feature related to transaction handling and fee bumping in a blockchain software project. Here is a breakdown of the main topics discussed in the passage:\n\n1. Feedback and Input: The project team takes feedback from users seriously and aims to improve based on their input.\n\n2. Documentation: Users are encouraged to refer to the project documentation for more details about the available qualifiers and how to use them.\n\n3. Project Questions: Users are directed to sign up for a GitHub account to ask questions or open issues related to the project.\n\n4. Bumping Commitments and HTLC Transactions: The project aims to provide a simplified way for users to bump their commitments and HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contract) transactions. This is done by implementing a small shim over their wallet/UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) source.\n\n5. Event Handler Permission: The event handler is granted permission to spend confirmed UTXOs for the transactions it will produce by implementing a specific interface.\n\n6. RBF Mempool Policy Requirements: The project addresses Replace-By-Fee (RBF) mempool policy requirements by ensuring that replacement transactions have higher feerate and absolute fee than conflicting transactions. However, due to the complexity of implementing this, it is left for future enhancements.\n\n7. Abstraction of LDK Descriptors: The project discusses the possibility of abstracting LDK descriptors to real descriptors, enabling signing of lightning transactions on hardware devices. This is considered a long-term goal.\n\n8. Integration with Bitcoin Core: The project suggests the possibility of integrating with Bitcoin Core's fundrawtransaction and other wallet RPC calls to avoid re-implementing coin selection abstractions and relying on the assumptions made by Bitcoin Core.\n\n9. Coin Selection Source: The project introduces the concept of a CoinSelectionSource implementation, which provides users with a transaction \"template\" that they can complete/finalize using their own coin selection algorithm.\n\n10. BumpId and ClaimId: BumpId is introduced as an identifier for pending output claims, which is later renamed to ClaimId. The discussion explores the need for dynamic computation of ClaimId and its implications for the CoinSelectionSource implementation.\n\n11. Weight Estimation and Assertion: The weight estimation code is discussed, and the need for assertions to ensure that the real weight is not higher than the estimated weight is mentioned. This is planned for follow-up testing.\n\n12. Anchor CPFP and Propagation: The project mentions the need for anchor CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) not propagating if the datacarrier option is turned off by the node operator. The behavior of other implementations in such cases is also considered.\n\n13. Fee Saturation and Saturating Multiplication: The code is reviewed for saturation issues related to fee saturation and multiplication operations. Saturation methods are suggested to avoid crashing.\n\n14. Weight Unit Computation: The weight unit computation is mentioned, and the need for rounding up in certain cases is questioned.\n\n15. Crash Scenarios and Fuzzing: The code is reviewed for potential crash scenarios when subjected to fuzzing and the need for robust crash handling is discussed.\n\n16. Debug Assertions: The need for debug assertions post-signing to ensure weight accuracy is raised.\n\n17. Final Review and Approval: The final approval for merge is given, with some follow-up points mentioned for further review and improvements.\n\nPlease note that the passage you provided is a mix of comments, code, and discussion fragments. It may be challenging to understand the full context without a deeper understanding of the project and the specific pull request.",
      "summaryeli15": "The purpose of this piece of code is to allow users to easily bump their commitments and HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract) transactions without having to worry about the specific details. It does this by requiring users to implement a small piece of code called a \"shim\" over their wallet or UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) source.\n\nThe code reads and takes into account all feedback and input from users very seriously. The goal is to improve and refine the code based on the feedback received. To see all the available qualifiers and details, you can refer to the documentation provided.\n\nIf you have any questions or issues with this project, you can sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to contact the maintainers and the community.\n\nThe main concept behind this code is to simplify the process of bumping commitments and HTLC transactions. It achieves this by providing users with a small piece of code called a \"shim\" that they need to implement over their wallet or UTXO source.\n\nBy implementing this shim, users grant permission to the event handler to spend confirmed UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) for the transactions it will produce. This allows users to bump their commitments and HTLC transactions without having to worry about the intricate details of the process.\n\nThe code also provides a way for users to provide feedback and ask questions about the project by signing up for a free GitHub account and opening an issue.

By clicking \"Sign up for GitHub,\" the person agrees to the terms of service and privacy statement. They may also receive account-related emails occasionally.\n\nThe next statement mentions that the organization is working on supporting finding a route to a recipient who is behind blinded payment paths. These blinded payment paths are provided in BOLT12 invoices, which are a type of invoice used in the Lightning Network. The organization has achieved a patch coverage of 94.61% and there has been a project coverage change of +0.81, which is a positive improvement.

      "summaryeli15": "This message is about a software project that is being developed on GitHub. The project is focused on finding a route to a recipient who is using blinded payment paths, which are specified in BOLT12 invoices. The message states that the project has achieved a patch coverage of 94.61% and a project coverage change of +0.81, which is a positive result. The comparison between the current state of the project and a previous state shows an increase in coverage.\n\nThe message also includes a notification that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration and may experience degraded service starting May 15th. The user is encouraged to install the GitHub App Integration for their organization to avoid this issue.\n\nThe message then suggests that the new serialization backwards-incompatible hints tlvs should be included in the next release of the project. This is considered important and the development team takes this input seriously.\n\nThe next part of the message discusses a potential change to the code. It suggests that a TODO comment should be added or the path should always be used directly. The reason for this suggestion is not clear from the message.\n\nThe message then mentions that the project is currently unable to use certain paths because the \"get_route\" function cannot advance the blinded path to the next hop. It also states that it is not possible to pathfind to ourselves. This limitation has been discussed previously in issue #2146.\n\nThe next part of the message suggests a solution to the above problem. It proposes that the \"get_route\" function should return early with a 0-hop unblinded path portion and the blinded tail as-is. The paying code would then handle this case by detecting it and advancing the path itself.\n\nAnother team member raises a concern about this proposed solution. They question how it would work if the maximum HTLC (a specific type of transaction) of the 1 blinded hint is not sufficient for the entire payment. This concern is not further elaborated on in the message.\n\nThe previous team member responds with a suggested solution to the concern. They propose that the path should be pre-selected and then the router can be run to select more paths if needed. They believe this solution would work easily.\n\nThe team members continue to discuss the implementation details of the proposed solution and address some potential issues and considerations. They also mention the need for a prefactor, as there are still assumptions in the code that the number of hops in the path is greater than 0.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to another topic related to decrementing available channel balances by the amount used on the path. One team member suggests addressing this in a follow-up, as the current pull request is already quite large. They believe that the behavior described should be added to the offers code, but keeping the find_route function general-purpose is also important.\n\nAnother team member asks a question about the behavior of sending extra sats (satoshis, a unit of Bitcoin) for a dummy hop included by the recipient. They wonder if there is anything to stop the recipient from always making the sender slightly overpay as long as there is a route with enough liquidity.\n\nThe first team member responds by explaining that dummy hops do not cost extra fees, as the fees for the entire blinded path are calculated by the recipient based on the non-dummy hops' feerates. They also mention that the recipient could make the sender overpay by adding extra fees on top of the aggregated fees. They note that the proposal encourages recipients to do this to avoid probing, but there are limits to how much the recipient can overcharge.\n\nThe conversation continues with some additional comments and suggestions for improvements. The team members state that they need to do a more detailed pass at the last commit and that there's a small thing worth fixing in a follow-up. They also mention that one of the code sections may not be reachable.\n\nThe message ends by stating that successfully merging this pull request may close certain issues related to the project and includes some coverage statistics for the project's files and code.",

      "summaryeli15": "This comment thread is a discussion about a pull request (PR) on a software development platform called GitHub. The PR is titled \"Closes #1222. This implements everything needed to support sending and receiving MPP keysend.\" The PR includes the necessary changes to enable the sending and receiving of MPP (multi-part payment) keysend.\n\nThe discussion thread begins with a comment acknowledging that some implementations reject keysend payments with payment secrets, and the user should be aware of this. It is also mentioned that there is no clear way to determine if a node supports MPP keysend, so the decision of when to use MPP keysend is left to the user.\n\nThe next comment notes that implementing MPP keysend requires a payment secret, which was not previously included in the PendingHTLCRouting::ReceiveKeysend function. Therefore, downgrading the software may break the deserialization process. To address this, a new flag called UserConfig::accept_mpp_keysend is added, allowing the user to opt-in to receive MPP keysend support.\n\nThe next comment states that the patch coverage for this PR is 95.63% and the project coverage change is +0.96. This means that the changes made by this PR have been extensively covered by tests and have improved the overall code coverage of the project.\n\nAfter that, there is a comment about a notification that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration, which may result in degraded service starting on May 15th. The user is advised to install the GitHub App Integration for their organization.\n\nThe following comments discuss some technical details and potential issues related to the implementation. They mention the need to check that all parts of the MPP keysend have the same payment secret and the conflict with passing payment metadata through the receive pipeline. There is also a plan to simplify the implementation by making some changes in another related PR. The idea of validating the payment secret is discussed, and it is agreed upon that it should be done for consistency and to support custom TLVs (Type-Length-Value). There is also a mention of consolidating some logic in the process_pending_htlc_forwards function.\n\nSome comments discuss how to handle the payment secret in the spontaneous payment method, whether to set it or not, and whether it should be lnd-specific. It is suggested that lnd rejects payment secret keysend, so it is proposed to set the payment secret only for multi-part keysend and leave it blank for other cases. There is also a suggestion to have a separate method for lnd-compatible keysend. The discussion continues with different options and ideas on how to handle the situation.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to the routing code and the potential issues related to using multi-part routes for a payee that doesn't support MPP keysend. The question is whether it would be better to use a single path route instead. The possibility of MPP support being set by default is also discussed.\n\nTowards the end of the comment thread, there are updates on the progress of the PR and the plan for further changes. There is also a request to squash the commits and clean up the git history.\n\nFinally, the PR is reviewed and approved, and the request to squash the commits is reiterated.",

The speaker mentions that they take feedback from users seriously and are open to input and questions about the project.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration, which may result in degraded service starting from May 15th. They encourage users to install the Github App Integration for their organization to avoid any issues.\n\nThe speaker then provides some statistics about the patch coverage and project coverage change, indicating that there is a high code coverage and a positive change in the project coverage.\n\nThe speaker mentions that they have removed support for phantom and that this change may break compatibility for current users of UserConfig::accept_intercept_htlcs. They are unsure if a release note will be sufficient to address this issue and would like feedback from others.\n\nNext, the speaker raises a concern about the accuracy of reporting the skimmed fee in cases where the counterparty overshoots the amount in the onion. They note that the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field may be offset by the difference between the amount_msat and total_value. Although this may not occur frequently and the offset may not be significant, the speaker wants to bring attention to it.\n\nAnother participant in the conversation agrees with the concern raised by the previous speaker and suggests that it may not be possible to detect if a non-penultimate intermediate node took less fee than intended by the sender. They mention that only sender_intended_total and actual_received_total are available for calculations.\n\nAnother participant suggests a possible solution by adding the skimmed fee to PendingHTLCRouting::Receive/ReceiveKeysend and using the values when calculating. They mention that it could be a follow-up task and question if it is worth fitting it in the current implementation.\n\nThe conversation continues with discussions about the possible implications of an intermediary node not taking enough fee and causing a payment to fail. It is mentioned that it would be useful to determine if the destination node is an LSP (Layered Service Provider) Client or just a routing node peer. This could be achieved by shorting 1 msat and observing if the payment fails.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges a mistake in their implementation and mentions that they have fixed it, incorporating both the previous and new solutions.\n\nOne participant suggests exposing the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field via PaymentClaimed, and this suggestion is repeated twice in the conversation.\n\nAnother participant raises a concern about the possibility of an attack where the payee fails a payment based on the skimmed fee being too high. They mention that the current documentation only states to check the amount_msat, but they note this attack for consideration.\n\nThe conversation continues with clarifications and corrections from participants. The speaker updates their code based on the feedback received and mentions that they have rebased their code to resolve conflicts.\n\nFinally, one participant reviews the code and provides approval with a minor comment and a suggestion to squash the changes.",

This indicates that the project has good code coverage, which means that most parts of the code are being tested.\n\nThere is also a note about the GitHub App Integration and a reminder to install it for the organization to avoid degraded service. This integration allows for better integration with GitHub and provides additional features and functionality.\n\nThe comment further explains that the phantom support has been removed for now and that this change may break compatibility for existing users of UserConfig::accept_intercept_htlcs. It is mentioned that a release note may not be sufficient to address this, so input and feedback is requested from the community.\n\nAnother point raised in the comment is regarding the accuracy of the skimmed fee calculation in the case of a counterparty overshooting the amount in the onion. It is acknowledged that this scenario may not happen often and the offset may not be significant, but it is still important to take note of it.\n\nThere is also a discussion about the possibility of detecting if an intermediary node took less fee than intended by the sender. It is mentioned that there may be limitations in the available data to detect this accurately.\n\nAnother suggestion made in the comment is to add the skimmed fee to the PendingHTLCRouting::Receive/ReceiveKeysend functions and use it when calculating the fee. It is mentioned that this can be done as a follow-up modification to the current change.\n\nThe comment also discusses the potential impact of an intermediary node not taking enough fee, which could cause a payment to fail. It is mentioned that this information could be used to determine if the destination node is a large-scale provider (LSP) client or just a routing node peer.\n\nThere is a mention of a fix made to address the accuracy of the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field.\n\nThe comment suggests exposing the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field via PaymentClaimed, which will provide more information about the fee skimmed by the counterparty.\n\nThere is a small discussion about whether the resulting amount should be None (indicating no subtraction) or zero, and it is decided to switch to None.\n\nThe comment also mentions that the pull request is rebased on another change to anticipate any conflicts that may arise.\n\nOverall, this comment highlights the various changes being made to support the skimming of an additional fee for intercepted HTLCs, as well as the discussions and considerations related to these changes.",

      "summaryeli15": "The statement is addressing a specific error called \"Min Mempool Fee\" that can occur when starting up the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd). The error is related to the minimum fee required to be paid for a transaction to be included in the Bitcoin mempool.\n\nTo understand this error, let's break down the statement and provide a detailed explanation:\n\n1. The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd):\n   - lnd is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node.\n   - A Lightning Network node is a software component that connects to the Lightning Network, a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables faster and cheaper transactions.\n   - lnd acts as a mediator for Lightning Network transactions, facilitating the transfer of funds between Lightning wallets.\n\n2. Pluggable Back-end Chain Services:\n   - lnd has several back-end chain services that it can connect to.\n   - These services include btcd, bitcoind, and neutrino.\n   - btcd and bitcoind are full nodes, which means they store and validate the entire Bitcoin blockchain.\n   - neutrino is a new experimental light client, which means it uses a more lightweight approach to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n3. BOLT Compliance:\n   - lnd fully conforms to the Lightning Network specification known as BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology).\n   - BOLTs are a set of technical specifications being developed by various implementers.\n   - lnd developers are actively involved in drafting these specifications.\n   - Compliance with BOLTs ensures that lnd interoperates correctly with other Lightning Network implementations.\n\n4. RPC Interfaces:\n   - lnd provides two primary RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces for developers to interact with it.\n   - The first interface is an HTTP REST API, which allows developers to send requests to lnd using HTTP.\n   - The second interface is a gRPC service, which is a more efficient and flexible way for applications to communicate with lnd.\n   - It's important to note that these API interfaces are not yet stable and may undergo significant changes in the future.\n\n5. Documentation and Resources:\n   - lnd provides a set of documentation for its RPC APIs, which can be found at api.lightning.community.\n   - This documentation helps developers understand how to interact with lnd programmatically.\n   - In addition to documentation, lnd also offers various developer resources such as guides, articles, example applications, and community resources that can be found at docs.lightning.engineering.\n   - These resources aim to support developers in building applications on top of lnd.\n\n6. Operational Safety Guidelines:\n   - When running a mainnet lnd node (connecting to the live Bitcoin network), it is important to follow operational safety guidelines.\n   - These guidelines are provided to ensure the proper usage and security of lnd.\n   - Ignoring these guidelines can lead to the loss of funds, so it's crucial to adhere to them when operating an lnd node on the mainnet.\n\n7. Security Disclosure:\n   - The developers of lnd prioritize security and privacy.\n   - If you discover any security or privacy vulnerabilities in lnd, the developers encourage responsible disclosure.\n   - To disclose such issues, you can send an email to security@lightning.engineering.\n   - It's recommended to encrypt the email using the designated PGP key provided by the developers to ensure the confidentiality of the information.\n\n8. Min Mempool Fee Error:\n   - The statement mentions a specific error related to \"Min Mempool Fee.\"\n   - This error occurs when starting up lnd and refers to the minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in the Bitcoin mempool.\n   - The mempool is a temporary storage area where pending Bitcoin transactions wait to be confirmed by miners.\n   - The error suggests that there might be an issue with handling the minimum fee requirement correctly in the lnd software.\n   - The developers of lnd acknowledge this error and aim to fix it so that lnd can start up without any issues.\n\nIn summary, the statement provides a detailed explanation of various aspects of the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd), including its implementation, back-end chain services, compliance with Lightning Network specifications, RPC interfaces, documentation, operational safety guidelines, security concerns, and a specific error called \"Min Mempool Fee\" that the developers are working to resolve.",

Refactoring: In one of the commits, there is a small refactoring done to extract the \"musig2 session logic\" into a new package and struct. This allows reusing the logic in tests without creating the entire wallet system.\n\n6. Preparing for updates: In the same commit, there are preparations to update the \"chanfunding\" package to support the new \"musig2\" channels.\n\n7. Generating nonces: In another commit, it is mentioned that a counter-based system is used to generate nonces for the local session. The commitment height is utilized as an underlying counter, and the shachain producer is used to generate fresh and deterministic randomness for the nonce.\n\n8. The next PR: It is mentioned that the next pull request in the series will utilize the changes made in the current PR to implement the funding logic within the wallet itself (reservations).\n\n9.

      "summaryeli15": "In this project, the developers have made some changes to the code to improve its functionality. They have implemented a new version of the musig2 session logic, which is a package that allows for secure and efficient multi-signature transactions. \n\nTo make their changes, the developers first refactored the musig2 session logic into a new package and struct. This allows them to reuse this logic in tests without having to create the entire wallet system. \n\nThey then made some preparations to update the chanfunding package to be compatible with the new musig2 channels. This package is responsible for handling the funding of channels, which are payment channels that allow users to make fast and cheap transactions.\n\nFor the local session, the developers decided to use a counter-based system to generate the nonces that are sent to the remote party. Nonces are random numbers that are used in the signing process to ensure the security of the transaction. In this case, the underlying counter is the commitment height, which is then used by the existing shachain producer to generate fresh but deterministic randomness. This means that they don't need to store the secret nonce on disk and can instead regenerate it when necessary. They can then combine this regenerated nonce with the signature they have on disk to create the final witness that is broadcasted.\n\nThe next part of the project will use these changes to implement the funding logic within the wallet itself.\n\nThroughout the process, the developers are actively seeking feedback and taking it seriously. They have also provided documentation for further reference and have opened up the project for questions and discussions within the community.\n\nThey have made multiple commits to their code, with each commit addressing different aspects of the project. The developers are also aware of any potential issues or bugs in their code and are working to address them.\n\nThey have also received feedback from reviewers, who have pointed out areas where improvements can be made or where additional testing is needed. The developers are taking this feedback into account and making the necessary changes to their code. Once they have addressed all the feedback, they will request another review from the reviewers.\n\nOverall, it seems like the developers are actively working on improving their code and are open to collaboration and feedback from the community.",

      "summary": "This is a detailed explanation of a series of commits in a software development project. The project is related to taproot channels, a technology used in cryptocurrency transactions. The developers are making changes to the existing code to integrate taproot channels into the internal funding flow.\n\nIn the first commit mentioned, the developers mention that they have read and considered all the feedback from users. They also refer to the documentation for more information on available qualifiers. They mention that if anyone has a question or issue regarding the project, they can sign up for a GitHub account and open an issue or contact the maintainers and the community.\n\nThe next commit builds on all the prior commits and integrates the new taproot channels into the existing internal funding flow. The developers mention that they have done some refactoring to unify certain processes like signing and verifying incoming commitment transaction signatures. They also mention that they use an existing functional option type to derive the local nonce based on an initial shachain pre-image that will be used as the revocation.\n\nThe developers also mention that they have connected the new funding flow to the existing internal wallet integration tests. They state that the last 14 commits are new and that there were some rebase issues that were found and fixed in commits marked with [temp]. They also mention that the next commit in the series will modify the channel state machine to understand the new commitment dance.\n\nIn response to a question, one developer explains that the nonce sent in the open_channel by the funder can be used to generate the final signature when receiving the funding_signed.nonce from the fundee.\n\nThe developers mention that in the fourth part of the series, they start binding the nonce creation with the transaction hash of the transaction they are about to sign. However, at that point, they need to send a nonce and do not yet know the transaction hash, so they cannot complete that step. They mention that they will still do it each time they go to sign a new commitment, as the transaction hash will be known at that stage.\n\nIn response to a comment about a compile error and a linter error, the developers acknowledge that they need to fix those issues.\n\nIn response to a question about the name \"simple taproot,\" one developer explains that the initial proposal for the project was more ambitious and included several features like taproot, PTLCs, new commitment type, and scriptless scripts. However, they decided to propose a staged roll-out instead, focusing on one feature at a time. That's how the name \"simple taproot\" came about.\n\nIn response to a comment about a linter error, the developers mention that there are a couple of linter errors that need to be fixed, most of them related to lll.\n\nIn response to a question about the calculation of the witness script for taproot channels, one developer mentions that the witness script will be calculated at the time of spending since it's necessary to know which branch is being spent in to build the control block. Another option mentioned is to add a boolean flag to indicate whether it's a local commit or not and pre-compute and return the witness script and control block accordingly. This would avoid deriving the tree twice.\n\nIn response to a comment about updating lc.currentHeight, the developers mention that it is always updated to date since it is only called when the StateCommitmentBroadcasted function is triggered, which means that the database has the latest view of the local commit and no other goroutines can update it anymore because it is closed.\n\nThe final commit mentioned logs that the attempt to add a tower client for taproot channels is not available yet.",
      "summaryeli15": "This pull request (PR) is part of a larger project in which several changes are being made to the codebase. The goal of this specific PR is to integrate new taproot channels into the existing funding flow and make some code improvements along the way.\n\nTo achieve this, the code undergoes several changes. The previous commits made prior to this PR are built upon, and the new taproot channels are added to the existing internal funding flow. Additionally, some refactoring is done to bring consistency to the codebase, particularly in the areas of signing and verifying incoming commitment transaction signatures.\n\nOne important aspect introduced in this PR is the use of a local nonce. A nonce is a number used only once, and it is typically used to add randomness or uniqueness to cryptographic operations. In this case, the local nonce is derived using the existing functional option type and is based on the initial shachain pre-image that will be used as our revocation.\n\nFurthermore, the new funding flow is connected to the existing internal wallet integration tests. These tests help ensure that the integration of the new taproot channels functions as expected.\n\nThe last 14 commits in this PR are new, and some of them include fixes to rebase issues (marked as [temp]) that were discovered along the way.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the next PR in this series will modify the channel state machine to support the new commitment dance.\n\nIf you have any questions or issues related to this project, you can sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and the community.\n\nThe developers appreciate the feedback they receive and take it seriously.

      "summary": "In this explanation, we are discussing a pull request (PR) on GitHub related to a project. The PR is proposing a solution for an issue (#7297) that involves persisting TLV (Type-Length-Value) data transmitted in the \"update_add_htlc\" function.\n\nThe PR starts by mentioning that they read and take feedback from users very seriously. They also provide a link to their documentation where users can find all the available qualifiers related to their project.\n\nIf users have any questions or concerns about the project, they are encouraged to sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to contact the maintainers and the community. By clicking \"Sign up for GitHub,\" the users agree to the project's terms of service and privacy statement. They may occasionally receive account-related emails.\n\nThe PR is being opened in draft mode to illustrate the potential solution's scope for issue #7297. The PR demonstrates a workaround for persisting TLV data transmitted in the \"update_add_htlc\" function. To save extra data provided through the PaymentDescriptor, the TLVs are encoded and set in \"channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData.\" The last commit is mentioned as an example of where this setting needs to be done.\n\nThe reason for illustrating the PR in draft mode is to describe the solution's scope and potential benefits to others. The PR suggests that even though this approach may not be ideal, it effectively solves the issue and avoids the need for migrations in this area. The PR also mentions the need for manually examining other areas to ensure that there are no other instances where an exact length is used instead of being serialized as variable bytes.\n\nThey suggest posting a separate comment or discussion about whether this PR should be merged as it is or combined with a larger preparatory route blinding PR. The person making the suggestion leans towards keeping the database workaround PRs more isolated, but they are open to either approach.\n\nThe PR then provides some details about how the HTLCs are serialized, deserialized, and stored. The TLV data is serialized and deserialized with updated functions and is always stored as variable bytes. The HTLC's fixed-size blob is read using the \"decodePayload\" function, and these HTLCs are serialized and deserialized as part of \"commitSet.\"\n\nLegacy nodes use functions like \"LogChainActions\" and \"FetchChainActions,\" which also perform serialization and deserialization using variable bytes.\n\nHTLCs are stored as variable bytes in \"ChannelCommitment\" and are reloaded into memory.\n\nThe PR receives positive feedback, with one comment mentioning that the PR is small and focused, and they appreciate the workaround for the specific issue. They leave a few comments for improvement but overall feel that the PR is almost ready to be merged.\n\nThere is a question about a specific test case, asking where it came from and suggesting that the onion blobs were always 1366 in size even before this change. In response, it is explained that previously, the OnionBlob was just a byte slice, so it could be less than 1366 bytes. However, it is clarified that they would never encounter onion blobs smaller than 1366 bytes in practice, as reading them would not be possible. The mention of the test case suggests that unit tests might have used random or junk data.\n\nThe latest push in the PR addresses some minor comments, adds additional comments, but does not introduce any functionality changes.\n\nFinally, there are positive comments appreciating the changes made in the PR, describing them as clear, concise, and well done. Merging this PR may close the related issues.\n\nIn summary, this PR proposes a workaround for persisting TLV data transmitted during a specific function in the project. The solution takes advantage of the known length and variable byte encoding of the existing HTLC struct to extend it with additional data. The PR receives positive feedback and minor suggestions for improvement.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this context, the term \"PR\" refers to a \"pull request,\" which is a proposed code change made by a developer and submitted for review by others before it is merged into the main codebase.\n\nThe pull request in question aims to address an issue related to persisting TLV (Type-Length-Value) data that is transmitted in the \"update_add_hltc\" function. TLV is a protocol that allows for flexible data structures by encoding information using a type indicator, a length field, and the actual data content.\n\nTo save extra data provided in a PaymentDescriptor, the proposed solution involves encoding the TLVs and setting the \"channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData\" field. This field will store the encoded TLV data, allowing for additional information to be associated with the HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract).\n\nThe PR also mentions a need to ensure that there aren't any other areas of the code where an exact length is used instead of serialized as variable length bytes. This review step is necessary to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues.\n\nThe comments on the PR generally express approval and support for the proposed solution, acknowledging that it may not be ideal but is a practical workaround. The PR has undergone some revisions to address minor issues but is deemed to be almost ready for merging.\n\nThere is also a question about a specific test case and clarification provided regarding the previous implementation of onion blobs, which were byte slices without a fixed length. The updated approach takes advantage of the fact that onion blobs are always 1366 bytes long in the Lightning protocol.\n\nOverall, the PR is seen as small and focused, and the proposed solution is considered clear and concise.

These functions are responsible for setting default values for two different configuration structs, `lncfg.Wtclient` and `lncfg.Watchtower`, respectively.\n\nThe purpose of these functions is to provide default values for the configuration options in case a user does not specify them. These default values will be used by the LND (Lightning Network Daemon) software when it starts up.\n\nBy populating the default values, when users run the `lnd --help` command, they will see the default values listed as options they can use.\n\nAdditionally, this code change removes a member called `PrivateTowerURIs` from the `WtClient` config struct. This member has been deprecated since version 0.8.0-beta of LND. Deprecated means that it is no longer recommended to use this feature, and it will be removed in the future. If a user were to specify this member, LND would fail to start.\n\nThis code change also includes some information for developers who want to ask questions or give feedback on this project.

The final or active status is required for the proposal to be considered a formally accepted standard.\n\n- \"Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin users (see also: economic majority)\": Individuals suggesting changes or modifications should keep in mind that the final approval ultimately relies on the consensus and agreement of the majority of Bitcoin users. The concept of economic majority is also mentioned, emphasizing the importance of considering the opinions of those who hold significant economic influence in the Bitcoin network.",
      "summaryeli15": "The passage you provided mentions different aspects related to the submission and approval process of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Let's break it down:\n\n1. Reading and taking feedback seriously: The creators of BIPs carefully read and consider all feedback they receive. They value input from the community and take it into account when making decisions.\n\n2. Documentation and qualifiers: The documentation provided by the creators of BIPs includes a list of available qualifiers. These qualifiers help categorize and define the different proposals.\n\n3. Working fast with the official CLI: The creators recommend using the official Command Line Interface (CLI) to work quickly and efficiently. The CLI provides tools and utilities for developers to interact with the Bitcoin network.\n\n4. GitHub Desktop: If the CLI doesn't work or you prefer a different approach, you can download GitHub Desktop. It is a graphical user interface that allows you to manage your code and interact with GitHub.\n\n5. Problem preparing the codespace: If you encounter any issues while preparing your codespace (a virtual environment for coding), you should try again. It's likely a temporary problem that can be resolved by retrying.\n\n6. Submitting BIPs: If someone wants to propose a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, they should first share their idea or document with the bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org mailing list. It's important not to assign a number to the proposal initially. The process is explained in more detail in BIP 2.\n\n7. Opening a PR: After the initial discussion and feedback, the proposer can open a \"Pull Request\" (PR). This means they submit their proposed changes to the official repository for review and consideration.\n\n8. Copy-editing and acceptance: If the proposal is deemed valuable and relevant, it goes through a copy-editing process to ensure clarity and consistency. Once it's approved, it will be published in the BIP repository.\n\n9. Approval process and decision-making: The creators of BIPs try to be liberal with approving proposals and aim not to make decisions for the community. However, in rare cases of disputes that cannot be resolved, a decision may be made to ensure progress. In these cases, the more cautious or conservative option is preferred.\n\n10. Formal acceptance: Just being in the BIP repository does not mean a proposal is formally accepted as a standard. It needs to undergo a process where its status becomes either \"Final\" or \"Active.\" This means it has been reviewed, accepted, and can be considered a standard for Bitcoin.\n\n11. Consent and consensus: Those proposing changes should keep in mind that the final decision rests with the consensus of Bitcoin users. The opinion and acceptance of the majority of users and stakeholders play a key role in determining which changes are implemented.\n\nLastly, the mention of \"clearer, more failure details, + use OP_TRUE\" suggests a desire for improvements in BIP proposals. The proposer is highlighting the importance of providing clear and detailed information, specifically regarding potential failures. The use of \"OP_TRUE\" refers to a specific operation code in Bitcoin scripting language that has its implications, which may need to be considered in proposals.",

The software provides a number of services that can be accessed and controlled through grpc. It also includes protocol buffer files and language bindings for easier integration.\n\nThe software can be used by applications to implement certain roles, such as managing and controlling the Lightning node. The key manager role is particularly important and only one application can implement this role at a time.\n\nTo get started with Blockstream Greenlight, you can use the python glcli command line tool. There are prebuilt packages available for glcli and gl-client-py on a private repository. These packages allow developers to start using the software without having to compile the binary extensions. However, if you encounter any installation issues, it may be due to the absence of a prebuilt version of the gl-client-py library. In that case, you can refer to the documentation on how to build the library from source and notify the developers of your platform so they can add it to their build system if possible.\n\nThe registration and recovery processes are managed by the scheduler. When registering as a new user, the scheduler provides an mTLS certificate and a matching private key that must be stored on the device and used for all future communication. The key manager must provide a signature to complete the registration process. The recovery process also requires the key manager to provide a signature.\n\nOnce the registration or recovery processes are completed, the user can access the Lightning node by using the provided URI. The user can manage the node just as if it were a local node, including sending and receiving on-chain transactions, opening and closing channels, etc. The node_id mentioned in the commands is a unique identifier for the node.\n\nThe language bindings provided by Blockstream Greenlight expect a 32-byte securely generated secret, which is used to generate all private keys and secrets. This secret should be kept safe on the user device and should not be stored on the application server, as it controls the user funds.\n\nTo ensure portability, the seed for the secret should be generated according to the BIP 39 standard. The mnemonic generated during the creation of the seed can be used to initialize other client applications with the same secret. However, the mnemonic should not be displayed or stored afterwards.\n\nBlockstream Greenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest. It is suggested to mostly use testnet for testing. The developers plan to open up the regtest network and add signet in the future to make testing simpler. However, the public testnet should suffice for testing purposes. It is important to note that the testnet can sometimes be unstable, and the lightning network running on testnet may not be as well-maintained as the main bitcoin network.\n\nCurrently, Blockstream Greenlight operates in a single cluster located in us-west2. Both the scheduler and the nodes are in this region. The developers plan to implement geo-load balancing of the nodes and associated databases to reduce the roundtrip times from other regions. Currently, the roundtrip times can be relatively high from distant regions, and the mTLS handshake requires multiple roundtrips the first time. This will be temporary until the geo-load balancing feature is rolled out.\n\nTo minimize the overhead of the mTLS handshake, it is suggested to keep the grpc connections open and reuse them whenever possible.\n\nThe provided commands (pip install, glcli scheduler register, glcli scheduler recover, etc.) demonstrate how to use the glcli command line tool to interact with Blockstream Greenlight. These commands allow you to register, recover, schedule, and manage your Lightning node.\n\nPlease note that this explanation provides an overview of the functionalities and usage of Blockstream Greenlight. For more detailed information and documentation, it is recommended to refer to the official documentation provided by the developers.",

This project is a telegram bot called @lnp2pbot, which has been steadily growing in popularity and is being used worldwide, with a particularly significant impact in Latin America. In regions like Cuba and Venezuela, where the local currency is facing significant challenges due to political instability, Bitcoin is being increasingly embraced as an alternative form of money.\n\nAlthough the @lnp2pbot works well, it operates on the Telegram platform, which raises concerns about potential censorship or government interference. To address this, a new platform called Nostr has emerged as a solution where a system like this can exist without the risk of being censored by a powerful entity.\n\nThe document explains how to create a censorship-resistant and non-custodial Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange on Nostr. To facilitate this exchange, a platform called Mostro is introduced. Mostro acts as an escrow service, reducing the risk for both buyers and sellers. It operates on top of Nostr and communicates peer-to-peer.\n\nMostro utilizes a Lightning Network node to handle Bitcoin transactions. The node creates hold invoices for sellers and pays buyers using regular Lightning Network invoices. To operate on Nostr, Mostro requires a private key to create, sign, and send events through the network.\n\nThe document provides a graphic illustrating the interaction between Mostro, the seller, and the Lightning Network node. It emphasizes that creating a reliable and trustworthy Mostro requires resources, such as maintaining a lightning node with sufficient liquidity and uptime close to 99.9%. To cover the costs, Mostros can charge a fee on each successful order. Users have the ability to rate Mostros, and competition among Mostros drives their efforts to attract more users.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the document explains that Mostro is being built on Rust. For individuals to participate in buying and selling Bitcoin through Mostro, they will need Mostro's clients and a Lightning Wallet. Initially, a web client is being developed, with plans to create mobile and desktop clients in the future.\n\nTo compile Mostro on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, the document provides commands to install the necessary dependencies, clone the repository, and create the required settings file. It also provides instructions for connecting with an lnd node by setting variables in the settings file.\n\nThe document mentions that data is stored in a SQLite database file named \"mostro.db,\" located in the project's root directory. The user can customize the database URL by editing the settings file accordingly. Before building Mostro, initializing the database using sqlx_cli is necessary.\n\nFor those who want to run Mostro with a private dockerized relay, specific instructions are given to spin up a new docker container instance. The relay URL to connect to in this scenario is provided as well.\n\nIn summary, the document provides a detailed explanation of the project's objectives, the role of Mostro as an escrow service, the architecture, implementation details, and instructions for setting up and running Mostro on various platforms.",

The goal is to have reliable and trustworthy Mostros running on the network, and the number of Mostros will be limited to ensure their reliability. Each Mostro will require a lightning node that is operational and has sufficient liquidity for fast transactions. The uptime of the node should be as close to 99.9% as possible. Mostros will be incentivized through fees paid by sellers on successful orders, with the fee percentage varying between Mostros.\n\nUsers will be able to rate Mostros, and Mostros will compete to attract more users to survive. Poorly rated or unreliable Mostros will lose incentives and may eventually be rejected by users.\n\nThe passage also provides instructions for compiling the Mostro platform on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, including setting up the necessary configurations for connecting with a LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node.

Encrypted communications with Nostr decentralized events.\n\nIn the Munstr system, the signer is responsible for using their private keys in a multisignature keyset to digitally sign a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT). The Nostr decentralized network acts as a transport and communications layer for the PSBT data.\n\nCoordinators play a crucial role in the Munstr system. They act as mediators between digital signers and wallets, facilitating the digital signatures from each required (n-of-n) key signers and assisting in broadcasting the fully signed transaction.\n\nIn addition to the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, Munstr also uses the bignum module for the \"bn2vch\" helper function. This function is used to convert numbers to byte-arrays suitable for CScript data pushes. To simplify the software, Munstr uses the current implementation from Bitcoin Core, using just a single function. For more details, Bitcoin Core PRs #17319 and #18378 can be referred to.\n\nTo set up the coordinator, the command \"cp src/coordinator/db.template.json src/coordinator/db.json\" is used.

      "summary": "In this passage, the focus is on the concept of Proof of Liabilities (PoL) in the context of an ecash system. The ecash system involves a mint that issues blind signatures to users, which can then be used as a form of electronic cash. The PoR (Proof of Reserves) part of the problem, which deals with on-chain attestation methods, is assumed to be already solved.\n\nThe passage describes how a user, named Carol, can withdraw funds from their Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment using the ecash. To do this, Carol sends the ecash to the mint and asks the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value. The mint then burns (destroys) the ecash and pays the invoice.\n\nIt is important to note that ecash is burned at every transaction and payout onto Lightning. This means that the lifetime of an ecash token is relatively short. As a result, the list of issued signatures (mint proofs) and the list of burned tokens can grow quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly.\n\nTo address this issue, the passage introduces the concept of key rotation as a simple solution. Key rotation involves periodically changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint. This mechanism can be used to construct the PoL scheme.\n\nFigure (a) in the passage illustrates the publicly released PoL reports of the mint. These reports include all mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and all burn proofs (redeemed secrets). A cheating mint would attempt to manipulate the reports by artificially shortening the list of mint proofs and inflating the list of burn proofs.\n\nFigure (b) shows how the mint's PoL (outstanding ecash balance) is compared to its PoR (on-chain assets). A cheating mint would try to artificially reduce the open balance, but it cannot inflate its on-chain assets.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the PoL reports, users verify whether their received blind signatures are included in the reports and whether an ecash token from a previous epoch is worth more than the outstanding balance of that epoch.\n\nIf a user finds that their blind signature is missing from the PoL reports, they can call out the mint for not listing it. To prove that they have a valid signature from the mint, the contesting user provides a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof. This proof allows others to verify that the signature is indeed from the mint.\n\nWhile revealing the DLEQ proof removes the privacy of the contesting user, it raises suspicion for all other users. A single unaccounted-for ecash token can trigger doubt in the mint, making it more likely that other users will challenge the reports.\n\nThe passage also explains another way a mint could lie about its PoL report. This involves including fake burn proofs (redeemed secrets) in its list of spent secrets. By doing this, the mint can artificially increase the amount of supposedly redeemed ecash and reduce the outstanding balance reported.\n\nTo address these challenges, the passage suggests key rotation. By periodically rotating the keys in an agreed-upon schedule, the mint commits to not adding any additional fake mint proofs to their past PoL reports. User wallets adopt a policy of refusing tokens from epochs other than the most recent one. This simulates a periodic \"bank run\" and allows users to observe past epochs to detect any manipulation by the mint.\n\nThe PoL scheme described in the passage ensures that a cheating mint can only artificially inflate its liabilities and not reduce them without the risk of being caught. If the mint inflates its liabilities, guardians of the reserves will request a withdrawal to maintain a constant percentage of funds. If it shrinks its liabilities, the mint risks being exposed by its users.\n\nOverall, the PoL scheme provides a trust model where a majority of the mint's funds are held in a multisig address controlled by independent parties. The eCash mint is operated by a single-entity that focuses on enabling efficient payments.\n\nThe passage concludes by acknowledging that there are still some problems that the proposed scheme does not address, and invites readers to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this context, PoL stands for Proof of Liabilities, which is a mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness and auditability of an electronic cash (ecash) system. The purpose of a PoL scheme is to verify that the mint, which is responsible for issuing ecash tokens, has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.\n\nThe excerpt you provided describes how the PoL works in the context of a specific problem. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Ecash and Lightning Wallets:\n- Ecash is a form of digital currency that can be used for transactions. It is issued by a mint and has value equivalent to traditional currency.\n- Lightning wallets are digital wallets that are used to send and receive payments through the Lightning Network, which is a scaling solution for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\n2. The Role of the Mint:\n- The mint is responsible for issuing ecash tokens to users and maintaining a record of all transactions.\n- When a user wants to withdraw ecash onto their Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment, they send the ecash to the mint and ask the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value.\n- Upon receiving the ecash, the mint burns (destroys) it and pays the Lightning invoice.\n\n3. Short Lifetime of Ecash Tokens:\n- Every time an ecash token is used in a transaction or paid out onto Lightning, it is burned by the mint.\n- This means that the lifetime of an ecash token is relatively short, as it gets destroyed in every transaction.\n- The result is that the list of issued signatures (proofs of minting) and the list of burned tokens (proofs of redemption) can grow quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly.\n\n4. The Problem of Growing Lists:\n- The growing lists of mint signatures and burned tokens can become unwieldy if not addressed.\n- To solve this problem, the concept of key rotation is introduced. Key rotation involves regularly changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint.\n\n5. Key Rotation and PoL Scheme:\n- Key rotation is used as a mechanism to construct the PoL scheme.\n- A new keyset (a set of keys) is generated and used for a specific epoch (a period of time). During this epoch, the mint issues ecash tokens and carries out transactions using these keys.\n- Once the epoch ends, a new keyset is generated for the next epoch, and the old keyset is retired.\n- The mint publicly releases PoL reports, which include all the mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and burn proofs (redeemed secrets) for a given epoch.\n- The PoL reports act as a public record of the mint's liabilities (outstanding ecash balance) for that epoch.\n\n6. Detecting Cheating by the Mint:\n- A cheating mint would try to manipulate the PoL reports to inflate its liabilities or hide fraudulent activity.\n- Users can verify whether a mint has manipulated the reports by checking if their blind signatures (received from the mint) are included in the PoL reports.\n- If a user finds that their blind signature is not listed in the PoL reports, they can call out the mint for manipulation.\n- In order to prove that they have a valid signature from the mint, the user contesting the report provides a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof, which allows others to verify the signature's authenticity.\n- It is important to note that publicly revealing the DLEQ proof removes the privacy of the contesting user, as it exposes the connection between the minting and burning of a specific ecash token.\n\n7. Fake Burn Proofs:\n- Another way a mint can cheat is by including fake burn proofs (unbacked ecash) in its list of spent secrets.\n- By doing this, the mint can artificially increase the amount of redeemed ecash and reduce the outstanding balance it reports.\n\n8. Effects of Key Rotation:\n- Key rotation has two main effects:\n  - It introduces an \"arrow of time\" to the token dynamics, meaning that users only accept tokens from the most recent keyset.\n  - This allows users to observe past epochs and determine if the mint has manipulated the reports.\n- By regularly rotating keys, the mint publicly commits to not add additional fake mint proofs to past PoL reports.\n- Users can validate the mint proof lists and easily detect any new entries or removal of legitimate ones.\n\n9. Trust Model of the PoL Scheme:\n- The PoL scheme is designed to create a trust model where the majority of the mint's assets are held in a multisig address controlled by multiple independent parties.\n- This ensures the security and integrity of the ecash minting operation, while enabling efficient payments through a single-sig entity.\n\n10. Open Issues and Suggestions:\n- The excerpt acknowledges that there are some unresolved problems and suggests that the proposal may not address all of them.\n- The authors invite readers to provide feedback or suggest improvements to the proposal.\n\nOverall, the PoL scheme described in the excerpt aims to provide transparency and accountability in an ecash system by using key rotation and public verification of mint proofs and burn proofs. It helps to prevent fraud and ensures that the mint's liabilities are in line with its assets.",

It provides a straightforward interface and an integrated on-chain wallet, making it simple for users to get started with Lightning network transactions.\n\nLDK Node is built using LDK and BDK, which are lightning and bitcoin libraries respectively. While LDK Node offers a user-friendly interface, it is important to have a deeper understanding of the protocol fundamentals and the LDK API to effectively set up interconnected modules.\n\nLDK, the underlying library, follows the separation-of-concerns principle. It is wallet-agnostic and doesn't come with an on-chain wallet. Therefore, users need to integrate LDK with a suitable on-chain wallet themselves.\n\nTo address the complexities of setting up LDK, LDK Node was created as a more fully-baked solution. It hides protocol complexities without sacrificing usability. The API of LDK Node is much smaller and simpler compared to LDK, making it easier to work with. Currently, LDK Node provides around 30 API calls, while LDK has more than 900 exposed methods.\n\nLDK Node strikes a balance between simplicity and expressiveness. While the LDK API leans towards expressiveness and allows for more configurability and interconnectivity, LDK Node prioritizes simplicity while still remaining flexible enough to operate a fully functional self-custodial Lightning node in different use cases.\n\nThe initial release of LDK Node comes with prepackaged design choices and ready-to-go modules. Its main goal is to simplify the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. The features in the initial release focus on mobile deployments and include integration with an Esplora chain data source and a Rapid Gossip Sync server. These integrations enable the node to function in mobile environments with limited bandwidth and overall traffic quota.\n\nLDK Node is primarily written in Rust and can be added as a library dependency to any standard Rust program. In addition to its Rust API, LDK Node also offers Swift, Kotlin, and Python language bindings based on UniFFI. It provides Flutter bindings as well, allowing the LDK Node library to be used in mobile environments.\n\nThe primary abstraction of the library is the Node, which can be obtained by configuring and setting up a Builder according to your preferences and calling one of the build methods. Once you have the Node, you can control it using commands such as start, stop, connect_open_channel, and send_payment.\n\nThe provided code snippet demonstrates the usage of LDK Node. It shows how to initialize the Builder, configure the network, Esplora server, and Rapid Gossip Sync server. It then builds the node and starts it. The example code also demonstrates how to interact with the Node by creating a new on-chain address, connecting to another node to open a channel, waiting for events, sending payments using an invoice, and finally stopping the node.",

      "summary": "The passage discusses the BTC Warp project, which aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network. Currently, new nodes and users need several days to sync a full Bitcoin node, which requires downloading and verifying the entire blockchain. This process is time-consuming and resource-intensive. BTC Warp aims to provide a solution by using zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to create a succinct, verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers.\n\nLight nodes are important in the Bitcoin ecosystem as they allow participants to connect and transact on the network without storing the full chain history or participating in consensus. They enable Bitcoin to scale and are utilized by phones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts. However, there is a need for a trustless way to verify the state of the Bitcoin chain.\n\nBTC Warp uses zkSNARKs to generate a proof of the validity of a header and the amount of work associated with it. By utilizing the succinctness property of zkSNARKs, BTC Warp allows new light clients to instantly verify the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain with significantly less storage (less than 30 kB). The ultimate goal is to extend this capability to SNARK the full Bitcoin blockchain for full nodes.\n\nThere are three types of Bitcoin nodes: light nodes, full nodes, and mining nodes. Light nodes are the focus of the BTC Warp project, as they provide a way for users to interact with the network without the hardware and networking requirements of full nodes.\n\nTo implement BTC Warp, the project utilizes recursive SNARKs, which are SNARK constructions that can verify other SNARKs. Recursive SNARKs allow for parallelization of proof generation, improving scalability and computational efficiency. BTC Warp uses Polygon's Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system for its benefits, including faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nGenerating the proofs using zkSNARKs is computationally expensive, so the project requires parallelization of computation and infrastructure to coordinate a tree of proofs. The proof generation process currently takes around $5000, but optimizations can reduce the cost to approximately $1000 for a one-time sync and even less for proof updates for new blocks.\n\nTo ensure that BTC Warp can verify new Bitcoin block headers, a composable tree approach is used. The Bitcoin syncing algorithm is implemented within a zkSNARK to verify the block headers' validity. The proof tree structure consists of layers, where each layer's circuit proves a claim of the start hash, end hash, and total work for a sequence of headers. The tree structure allows for faster proof generation and guarantees proofs for blocks produced in the future.\n\nHowever, a limitation of the current construction is that it can only prove up to a certain block number. To accommodate future blocks, a modification is made to the circuit to handle dummy values until the desired block number is reached. The modification ensures that the parent hash of a header matches the hash of the previous header.\n\nTo obtain BTC block headers, the project uses the Nakamoto light client library, which is written in Rust. The Nakamoto library listens to network gossip and provides block headers through a basic API. Optimization and benchmarking are conducted to determine the most cost and time-effective way to generate the proofs.\n\nBTC Warp's infrastructure flow involves BTC P2P gossip, block header retrieval through the Nakamoto library, and the generation of BTC Warp proofs. The project also explores potential improvements, such as circuit serialization and efficient data structures like Utreexo, to handle the large size of UTXOs in a block.\n\nThe passage concludes by mentioning potential use cases for zero-shot sync BTC and inviting developers to join the team or explore partnerships. The project can be followed on Twitter and contacted via email for further inquiries.",
      "summaryeli15": "BTC Warp is a project that aims to solve the problem of syncing light client nodes to the Bitcoin network.

They are useful for users who don't want to meet the networking and hardware requirements of full nodes, such as mobile phones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts. However, light nodes still need to know the state of the BTC chain and interact with other nodes for data.\n\nThe BTC chain is currently very large, with almost 790,000 blocks and over 2,000 transactions per block. Downloading and verifying each block header takes time and computational resources that scale with the size of the chain. BTC Warp aims to solve this problem by using zkSNARKs to generate a concise proof of the validity and work associated with each block header.\n\nzkSNARKs are a cryptographic tool that allows the generation of proofs that some computation has a specific output without revealing the computation itself. In the case of BTC Warp, zkSNARKs are used to generate proofs that a block header has a certain amount of work associated with it. This proof can be verified quickly, even though the underlying computation to generate it may take a long time.\n\nThe BTC Warp proof generation algorithm is implemented inside a zkSNARK. The algorithm verifies that each block header forms a valid chain and increments the total work of the chain by the work in each header. However, due to the size of the BTC chain, some challenges arise. There is a theoretical limit to the number of block headers that can be included in a zkSNARK circuit due to the limitation of Groth16 proving systems. BTC Warp overcomes this limitation by using recursive SNARKs, which can verify other SNARKs, to parallelize proof generation.\n\nRecursive SNARKs allow BTC Warp to compose a \"proof tree\" where each layer of the tree has a different circuit. This parallelization improves scalability, computational efficiency, and reduces the degree of centralization. Polygon's Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system is used for this purpose due to its benefits, such as faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the construction of recursive SNARKs is complex and requires considerations about extensibility of the proof. BTC Warp uses a composable tree approach, where each layer of the proof tree verifies a sequence of block headers. This design enables faster and cheaper initial proof generation while guaranteeing proofs for blocks produced far into the future.\n\nTo implement BTC Warp, the project uses the Nakamoto light client library to obtain BTC block headers. The project's circuits are written in Rust, and Nakamoto is a Rust-based library, which facilitates integration. Nakamoto listens to network gossip to update the proof for new blocks and provides a basic API to serve block headers.\n\nTo generate new block proofs, BTC Warp sets up a listener to the light client to detect new blocks. When new blocks are detected, a Fargate instance is spawned to update the proof tree with O(log(d)) complexity. Further optimizations can be made to reduce proof generation time and costs by tuning parameters such as tree height, the number of proofs per proving instance, and the number of proving instances.\n\nBTC Warp's ultimate goal is to be able to SNARK the full Bitcoin blockchain for full nodes. Currently, the size of the BTC chain poses a challenge, but using efficient data structures within zkSNARKs, such as Utreexo, can potentially reduce storage requirements for full block and transaction verification.\n\nIn addition to solving the light client sync problem, BTC Warp has potential use cases in other areas. Some examples mentioned include trustless asset proofs, escrow transactions, and general-purpose applications. The project is also open to collaboration and invites developers with relevant experience to join their team.",

      "summary": "This abstract discusses the fee differences between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees one may expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. The concept of out of band fees is explored as a potential explanation for these differences. Out of band fees refer to fees that are paid outside of the standard transaction fee market.\n\nThe abstract begins by stating that there is evidence suggesting that the recent increase in fee differences may not be as significant as some people may think. The evidence for increases in out of band fees may therefore be limited.\n\nThe abstract then discusses the problem of sending transactions directly to a miner, which slows down block propagation between mining pools. When intermediate nodes don't know about a transaction, compact blocks don't work efficiently, creating centralization pressure. However, if a transaction is standard and pays enough fee to end up in all mempools, the out of band payment can be used to top up the fee for faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that out of band fees should not ideally exist, as the memory pool is supposed to be an open competitive fee marketplace. However, it states that they may be popular for various reasons such as privacy concerns, urgent transactions, or the desire for faster confirmation times.\n\nThe abstract concludes by stating that out of band fees may be inevitable and unstoppable. However, it emphasizes the need for education, wallet development, and Bitcoin Core transaction selection policies to minimize the potential opportunity for out of band fees.\n\nThe abstract then references the website miningpool.observer, which displays a candidate block from its local instance of Bitcoin Core for every block produced by the miners. The fee difference between the local Bitcoin Core node candidate block and the actual mined block is considered a key metric to analyze.\n\nThe abstract also mentions that Mempool.space has added a similar feature called \"Audit\" to their website. It notes that some observers have commented anecdotally that actual blocks recently contained more fees than the mempool.space blocks, indicating an increase in positive fee differences. However, this spike may also be due to a bug that has been fixed.\n\nFigures are provided to illustrate the data on miner fees and fee differences between actual blocks and block templates. The fee differences are presented as a percentage of total fees and are analyzed by mining pool.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that Bitcoin fees have increased rapidly in the recent period, possibly due to increased demand for block space caused by Ordinals and \"BRC-20\" tokens. This increased activity may have made it harder for some mining pools to keep up.\n\nOverall, the abstract suggests that while out of band fees may continue to exist, efforts should be made to minimize their potential impact through education, wallet development, and transaction selection policies.",

The block template data is from a Bitcoin node run by Sjors Provoost, and the chart includes information from different mining pools.\n\nThe author then discusses the problem of sending transactions directly to a miner, which can slow down block propagation between mining pools.

Each party creates their own secret polynomial and shares evaluations of this polynomial with other parties to create a distributed FROST key.\n\nThe final FROST key is represented by a joint polynomial, where the x=0 intercept is the jointly shared secret. Each participant in the system controls a single point on this polynomial at their participant index.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials determines the threshold of the multisignature, which is the minimum number of points required to interpolate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret. This threshold is denoted as T-1.\n\nIn FROST, T parties can collaborate to interpolate evaluations using the secret value f[0] without fully reconstructing this secret. This is different from Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret must be reconstructed.\n\nThe question arises whether it is possible to change the number of signers N and the threshold T after the key generation process has been completed. The key generation process refers to the initial creation of the distributed FROST key.\n\nIt is desirable to be able to change the number of signers and the threshold with the consent of only a threshold number of signers, rather than requiring the consent of all N signers. The motivation behind this is to allow for the reissuance of a FROST secret keyshare in case it is lost or compromised.\n\nSome ideas for achieving this have been explored in the secret sharing literature, but explicit methods are not described in the document. The document acknowledges the need to further study which methods are proven secure and appropriate for the purpose.\n\nOne possible approach described in the document is to turn a threshold of N (t of n) into a threshold of (N-1) (t of (n-1)) by trusting one user to delete their secret keyshare. However, this approach requires the number of signers, N, to be greater than the threshold value, t.\n\nIf the party cannot be reliably trusted to delete their secret keyshare, it is suggested to make the revoked secret keyshares incompatible with future multisignature participants. This can be achieved using some form of proactive secret sharing, where shares are periodically renewed without changing the secret.\n\nProactive secret sharing prevents an adversary from leveraging information gained in one time period to attack the secret after the shares are renewed.\n\nTo decrease the threshold, the document suggests sharing a secret of a single party with all other signers. This allows every other party to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively turns a threshold of N (t of n) into a threshold of (N-1) (t-1 of (n-1)). It is also mentioned that the number of signers, N, can be kept the same if there is a method to increase the number of signers.\n\nThe document acknowledges that issuing new signers is more involved and suggests an enrollment protocol to add a new party without redoing the key generation process. The enrollment protocol involves T parties collaborating to evaluate the joint polynomial at a new participant index and securely sharing this new secret keyshare with the new participant.\n\nAnother method mentioned in the document is to modify the key generation process to include extra secret shares that can be used to issue new signers in the future. Each party in the key generation process evaluates additional secret shares beyond the original N shares. These additional secret shares are later distributed among the signers to add new parties. Shamir secret sharing can be used to distribute these secret shares while maintaining the threshold requirement.\n\nIncreasing the threshold after the key generation process seems more difficult and would require somehow increasing the degree of the polynomial and trusting everyone to delete the old polynomial.\n\nThe document concludes by expressing enthusiasm for the FROST system and acknowledging the contributions of @LLFourn in providing feedback, ideas, and knowledge of existing literature.",
      "summaryeli15": "FROST's distributed key generation is a process in which multiple parties work together to create a secret key. Each party creates a secret polynomial, which is a mathematical function with unknown coefficients. To create the final FROST key, the parties share evaluations of their polynomials with each other.\n\nThe FROST key is represented by a joint polynomial, which is a polynomial that all parties have a point on. The x=0 intercept of this polynomial represents the jointly shared secret, denoted as s. Each party controls a single point on this polynomial, based on their participant index.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials determines the threshold of the multisignature. The threshold, denoted as T, determines the number of points required to interpolate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret. In simpler terms, the threshold determines how many parties need to work together to create a valid signature.\n\nT parties can interact to interpolate evaluations of the polynomial using the secret f[0], without actually reconstructing this secret. This is different from Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret needs to be reconstructed.\n\nThe question arises whether it is possible to change the number of signers (N) and the threshold (T) after the key generation process has been completed. And importantly, can these changes be made with only a threshold number of signers, instead of requiring the consent of all N signers?\n\nOne possible approach is to trust one user to delete their secret keyshare, effectively decreasing the number of signers from N to N-1. It is important to ensure that the number of signers (N) is greater than the threshold (T) to maintain security.\n\nIf one cannot rely on a party to delete their secret keyshare, the revoked secret keyshares can be rendered incompatible with future multisignature participants. This can be achieved through proactive secret sharing, a method where shares are periodically renewed without changing the secret. This renders any information gained by an adversary useless for attacking the secret after the shares are renewed.\n\nTo decrease the threshold, a secret of a single party can be shared with all other signers. This allows every other party to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively reduces the threshold, turning a T of N into a (T-1) of (N-1). To maintain the same number of signers, a brand new secret keyshare can be issued and distributed to all other signers.\n\nIn more adversarial scenarios, steps can be taken to manage a fair exchange of the secret to ensure it reaches all participants.\n\nEnrollment protocols can be used to add a new party without redoing the key generation process. These protocols allow for the repair or addition of a new party without starting from scratch. A threshold number of parties collaborate to evaluate the joint polynomial at the new participant index and securely share the new secret keyshare with the new participant.\n\nAlternatively, a proof of concept recovery method can be used to add new signers to the FROST multisignature without requiring all N signers to be present. This method involves modifying the key generation process to generate extra secret shares that can be used to issue new signers later on. These secret shares can be shamir secret shared to ensure that multiple parties need to collaborate to create a new signer.\n\nIncreasing the threshold after the key generation process seems more difficult than redoing the key generation process. It would require increasing the degree of the polynomial and trusting everyone to delete the old polynomial.\n\nOverall, FROST provides a flexible approach to distributed key generation, allowing for adjustments to the number of signers and the threshold after the initial key generation process while maintaining security.",

      "summary": "This blog post explains the process of opening and closing a Lightning Network channel in great detail. It assumes prior knowledge of the concepts of Alice and Bob, as well as some preliminary information about channels and transactions. It also includes diagrams to help illustrate the various steps and states involved.\n\nThe blog post starts by mentioning that Alice and Bob have successfully opened their channel, and both parties have confirmed that the funding transaction has gone through. They have also exchanged the channel_ready message to indicate their readiness to use the channel. The state of their asymmetric commitment transactions is described, but for simplicity, the funding transaction and other details are temporarily ignored in the diagrams.\n\nTo send a payment across the channel, either Alice or Bob needs to propose the inclusion of an HTLC (Hash-Time-Locked Contract) to their channel peer. This is done using the update_add_htlc message, which includes information such as the channel ID, an identifier for the proposed change, the amount to be attached to the HTLC output, the expiry height for the HTLC, and data for routing the payment.\n\nIf Alice sends an update_add_htlc message to Bob, he can add the HTLC to his staging area commitment transaction, while Alice marks it as pending on Bob's side but does not add it to her staging commitment transaction yet. It is important to note that until the HTLC is irrevocably committed by both parties, Bob should not send the update_add_htlc message to the next hop in the payment route.\n\nThe blog post goes on to explain that when an HTLC is added, the value of Alice's main output in Bob's staging commitment transaction is reduced by the amount of the HTLC (along with fees). If the HTLC succeeds, the amount will be added to Bob's output, and if it fails, it will be re-added to Alice's output.\n\nIt is possible to add multiple changes to the staging area before committing to them. Alice can propose new HTLCs, such as A2, to Bob, even if the previous HTLC (A1) has not yet been irrevocably committed.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers will want to ensure that the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending the commitment_signed message. The message includes the required signatures from the sender (Bob, in this example) to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction. It is important to note that the signature should not cover the HTLC (B1) for which Alice has not sent an acknowledgement yet.\n\nBob, incentivized to revoke his previous commitment transaction, sends the revoke_and_ack message in response to Alice's commitment_signed message. This revokes the previous state, and Bob now has two valid commitment transactions (the old one and the new one). However, he is encouraged to revoke the previous commitment transaction because the HTLCs on the new state offer better conditions.\n\nThe blog post presents different diagrams to depict the states of Alice's and Bob's commitment transactions and highlights that the transactions can remain out of sync indefinitely until both parties commit to them. It explains the consequences of these transactions ending up on-chain from both perspectives.\n\nThe process continues with Alice proposing another HTLC (A3) to Bob and Bob sending his own commitment_signed message to Alice. They continue exchanging revoke_and_ack messages to revoke previous states and acknowledge the commitment to certain HTLCs.\n\nOnce all the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed, the blog post explains the process of removing HTLCs. They can be removed if a payment succeeds (using the update_fulfill_htlc message) or if it fails (using the update_fail_htlc or update_fail_malformed_htlc message). The update_fulfill_htlc message is sent when an HTLC is fulfilled, and the update_fail_htlc message is sent to communicate HTLC failures. The update_fail_malformed_htlc message is used when there was an issue parsing the onion_routing_packet of the HTLC.\n\nThe blog post demonstrates the removal of HTLCs by including diagrams showing the updated states after the various removal messages are exchanged between Alice and Bob. It mentions that the removal messages must be irrevocably committed before taking effect. The HTLCs are only removable once they have been irrevocably committed.\n\nThe blog post concludes by explaining the process of closing a channel cooperatively. It mentions that both parties need to decide on a final closing transaction that will spend from the funding transaction and pay each of them their final channel balance immediately.\n\nBob initiates the closing process by sending the shutdown message to Alice. Once all the HTLCs have been cleared, Alice and Bob can negotiate a fee for the final closing transaction. The funder of the channel, in this case, Alice, starts the negotiation by proposing a fee rate. If Bob agrees, he can sign the closing transaction and broadcast it, closing the channel. If Bob disagrees, he can send a counterproposal with a new fee rate.\n\nThe blog post explains that once the closing transaction is broadcasted and confirmed, the channel is officially closed. It notes that if the channel was public, other nodes in the network will remove it from their routing graphs upon seeing the funding output being spent.\n\nThe post concludes by highlighting the benefits of the Lightning Network, where millions of HTLCs can be exchanged between parties without everything showing up on-chain.\n\nOverall, the blog post provides a detailed explanation of the process, including the different messages exchanged, the states of commitment transactions, and the removal of HTLCs. It also clarifies that the provided information may be subject to updates or corrections.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this blog post, the author explains the process of adding and removing Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) in a Lightning Network channel between two parties, Alice and Bob. The Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin that allows for faster and cheaper transactions by creating payment channels between users.\n\nFirst, Alice and Bob open a channel by creating a funding transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once the funding transaction is confirmed, Alice and Bob exchange a \"channel_ready\" message to indicate that they are ready to start using the channel.\n\nTo send a payment across the channel, either Alice or Bob needs to propose the inclusion of an HTLC to the other party. This is done using the \"update_add_htlc\" message. The message includes information such as the channel ID, an identifier for the proposed change, the amount to be attached to the HTLC, the block height at which the HTLC should expire, and data for the recipient to determine where to send the payment.\n\nLet's say Alice sends Bob an \"update_add_htlc\" message, proposing the addition of HTLC A1. If Bob agrees with the proposal, he adds the HTLC to his staging area commitment transaction, and Alice marks the HTLC as pending on Bob's side but does not add it to her staging commitment transaction yet.\n\nIt's important to note that the HTLC is not considered irrevocably committed until both parties have committed to the channel with or without it. Therefore, if Bob is a routing node for this payment, he should not send the \"update_add_HTLC\" message to the next hop until A1 has been irrevocably committed.\n\nWhen an HTLC is added to the staging area, the value of Alice's main output in Bob's staging commitment transaction (to_remote output) will have the added HTLC subtracted, along with the fees to cover the extra output. If the HTLC succeeds, the amount will be added to Bob's output, and if it fails, it will be re-added to Alice's output.\n\nEven though they haven't committed to HTLC A1 yet, Alice can propose a new HTLC, A2, to Bob. They can continue adding changes to the staging area without committing to them.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers wants to ensure that the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending the \"commitment_signed\" message. Let's say Alice sends this message to Bob, who now has all the required signatures from Alice to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction.\n\nIt's important to note that the commitment transactions can remain out of sync indefinitely, and Bob does not need to send \"commitment_signed\" just because Alice did. They can continue adding new changes to the staging area.\n\nOnce Bob receives the \"commitment_signed\" message, he sends the \"revoke_and_ack\" message to revoke his previous state and acknowledge that Alice has received and committed to the HTLCs.\n\nThis process of proposing changes, signing commitments, and revoking previous states continues until all the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed.\n\nRemoving an HTLC can occur if a payment succeeds or fails. The peer who did not send the original \"update_add_htlc\" message can send an \"update_fulfill_htlc\" message to remove an HTLC if it's being fulfilled. The peer who sent the message can immediately send the pre-image upstream to claim any HTLCs there.\n\nHTLCs can also be removed due to payment failures, which are communicated with the \"update_fail_htlc\" message. If any hop is unable to parse the onion_routing_packet it received in the \"update_add_htlc\" message, the \"update_fail_malformed_htlc\" message is sent.\n\nTo irrevocably commit the removal of HTLCs, both parties go through a process of exchanging messages like \"commitment_signed\" and \"revoke_and_ack.\"\n\nFinally, when the channel is ready to be closed in a cooperative way, the peers negotiate a final closing transaction that will spend from the funding transaction and pay each party their final channel balance immediately. This is done by exchanging \"shutdown\" and \"closing_signed\" messages.\n\nOnce the HTLCs have been cleared, the peers negotiate a fee for the final closing transaction. The funder of the channel initiates this negotiation. They exchange messages with proposed fee rates until they agree or one party decides to force close the channel. The closing transaction is then broadcasted and confirmed on the Bitcoin network, officially closing the channel.\n\nThroughout the entire process of adding and removing HTLCs, only the opening and closing transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making the Lightning Network a scalable solution for fast and cost-effective Bitcoin transactions.",

      "summary": "The text explains how ACINQ, one of the main developers and operators of the Lightning Network, has addressed the security challenges of operating a Lightning Network node. ACINQ needed a secure solution for their Lightning node as it requires private keys to be \"hot\" or always online. They have settled on using a combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano, which they believe provides the best trade-off between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity.\n\nThe Lightning Network is an open payment network built on top of Bitcoin. It is a fast, scalable, and trust-minimized network of nodes that relay payments. These nodes are reachable from the internet, process real-time transactions, and manage private keys that control the operator's funds. However, since Lightning nodes are essentially hot wallets, they are prime targets for hackers.\n\nACINQ has developed an open-source Lightning implementation called Eclair, specifically designed for large workloads. It is written in Scala and runs on the JVM. Eclair powers the ACINQ node, which manages hundreds of Bitcoin and tens of thousands of channels. ACINQ expects these numbers to grow in the future, which is why they invested early on in researching and implementing a secure solution.\n\nInitially, ACINQ planned to use an off-the-shelf Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect their private keys. However, since their node runs on AWS, they couldn't physically plug a card into their servers. To maintain the flexibility of using a cloud provider like AWS, ACINQ decided to split their deployment. They used the AWS Nitro Enclaves, an Isolated Compute Environment, to securely run their Lightning node, while using a Ledger Nano as a signing device with a trusted display.\n\nRouting payments on the Lightning Network requires more than just protecting private keys. ACINQ had to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSM to ensure that outgoing and incoming payments are properly linked and verified. This was challenging as HSMs have limited memory and storage capabilities. They had to store encrypted data on the HSM's host filesystem and pass it back and forth for each payment, increasing the complexity of the deployment.\n\nAdditionally, the HSM needed access to the Bitcoin blockchain to authenticate channels and ensure payments were safe. ACINQ discovered that verifying Lightning payments and channels is more complex than anticipated, and they had to find a way to work with Bitcoin data without implementing a full node in the HSM.\n\nThe complete HSM application turned out to be larger than expected, adding complexity and maintenance costs. The deployment was split into multiple parts, making operations difficult and risky. The performance of HSMs was also slower compared to high-end servers, limiting the number of payments that could be processed.\n\nTo address these challenges, ACINQ turned to AWS Nitro Enclaves. Nitro Enclaves can run any application and don't require the programming constraints of other trusted runtimes. ACINQ built a secure master repository for their secrets using Nitro Enclaves and leveraged Nitro Attestations to establish secure tunnels between their application and the master repository.\n\nACINQ also used Ledger devices to provide an additional layer of security. They developed a custom Ledger application that runs on Ledger devices to sign applications and secure sensitive administration tasks. The Ledger devices' trusted display complements the security provided by Nitro Enclaves.\n\nWith this setup, ACINQ can run their Lightning node securely without the need for physical access to air-gapped machines or custom HSM firmware. They can deploy and upgrade their Lightning node similar to before, with the added signing step using Ledger devices.\n\nThe combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger devices provides ACINQ with a secure, cost-effective, and maintainable solution for operating their Lightning node. This solution also offers the flexibility to easily switch to other production environments that deploy Confidential Computing Environments. ACINQ believes that their solution is the best fit between security, cost, and maintainability for running a professional Lightning node.",

They redesigned their setup to include Nitro Enclaves and a Ledger Nano for authentication operations.\n\nThe Lightning Network relies on payment channels anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain. Payments made through channels don't need to be recorded on-chain, which allows for scalability. When a payment is made from one node to another, it is actually split into smaller sub-payments that are routed through intermediaries. These intermediaries are called routing nodes.\n\nTo secure their Lightning node, ACINQ had to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on their HSM. This was challenging because HSMs have limited memory and are designed for signing documents instead of handling the complex state transitions required by Lightning.\n\nThey also needed the HSM to have knowledge of the Bitcoin blockchain to authenticate channels and ensure that payments are secure. They found a way to work with Bitcoin data without implementing a full node in the HSM, but it involved significant development and verification efforts.\n\nImplementing the Lightning protocol on the HSM turned out to be more complex and costly than expected. They faced challenges related to development, maintenance, and operational complexity. HSMs also had poor I/O and CPU performance compared to high-end servers, limiting the number of payments they could process.\n\nTo address these challenges, ACINQ turned to AWS Nitro Enclaves. Nitro Enclaves provide a secure isolated environment where applications can run while being protected from the underlying infrastructure. ACINQ used Nitro Enclaves to run their Eclair application, which handles I/O through TCP sockets.\n\nThey also used Nitro Enclaves to build a secure master repository for their secrets. They leveraged Nitro Attestations to establish secure tunnels between their application and the master repository. Secrets were encrypted and transferred between the enclave and the master enclave for secure storage.\n\nTo ensure the integrity and authenticity of their application, ACINQ used Ledger devices. Ledger devices have trusted displays that allow administrators to verify package hashes and sign sensitive operations. They developed a custom Ledger application that runs on trusted devices to sign applications and perform administration tasks.\n\nBy combining AWS Nitro Enclaves with Ledger devices, ACINQ achieved a high level of security for their Lightning node. They were able to run Eclair without major changes and maintain the same performance and operational processes as before.\n\nThis solution also provides flexibility, as ACINQ is not locked into AWS and could easily migrate to other cloud providers that offer similar Confidential Computing Environments. They believe that their solution offers the best trade-off between security, cost, and maintainability for running a professional Lightning node.",

It explains that Simplicity expressions are constructed using combinators, which build up expressions from smaller ones. These expressions represent functions that take an input and map it to an output.\n\nThe passage provides an example of a simple Simplicity program that takes an empty input and produces an empty output, referred to as the \"iden\" program. It then shows how bit inversion can be achieved in Simplicity and compares it to Bitcoin Script and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe passage explains that Simplicity makes writing code for bit inversion more verbose, but in practice, such code will only be written once and then reused. It mentions the availability of shortcuts, called \"jets,\" that make it easier to write code for common operations.\n\nIt states that the real work in blockchain programs will be done in higher-level languages that compile down to Simplicity code, accompanied by proofs of their correct operation.\n\nThe passage also explains the concept of programs in Simplicity, which are expressions that have trivial input and output values. It mentions that these programs are useful and the only type of expressions allowed on the blockchain.\n\nThe two strategies mentioned for using Simplicity programs are having holes in committed programs that are filled in when coins are spent, and having side effects that allow access to blockchain data or early termination of programs.\n\nThe passage discusses different ways to specify holes in Simplicity programs, such as using the \"disconnect\" and \"witness\" combinators. It explains that witnesses are values of a given type that serve as program inputs.\n\nIt also mentions the ability of Simplicity programs to have side effects, such as introspecting transaction data and using assertions to halt program execution. It compares the VERIFY opcode in Bitcoin Script and the STOP opcode in EVM, which serve similar purposes.\n\nAn example program is provided to showcase the use of witnesses and assertions in Simplicity. The program checks the equality of two witnesses.\n\nThe passage concludes by mentioning that Simplicity has several more combinators and jets, which will be discussed in future posts. It hints at exploring more practical examples and discussing the process of proving properties of programs.\n\nIt encourages readers to join the Simplicity discussions on GitHub, ask questions, connect with the community, and follow @blksresearch on Twitter for updates on Simplicity blog posts.",

It is also \"sidechain-capable,\" which means it can be used to create and operate sidechains. A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is connected to a main blockchain, such as Bitcoin, and allows for the creation of new and innovative applications without affecting the main blockchain's stability.\n\n4. A fully open-source hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid: A hardware wallet is a physical device that securely stores a user's private keys, which are necessary to access and manage their Bitcoin and Liquid assets. A fully open-source hardware wallet means that the device's design and software are publicly available for inspection and review, ensuring transparency and security for its users.\n\n5. A multi-platform, feature-rich Bitcoin and Liquid wallet: This refers to a software application or platform that allows users to store, send, receive, and manage their Bitcoin and Liquid assets. It is designed to work on multiple platforms, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, and web browsers, and offers a range of features to enhance the user experience, such as transaction history, address management, and security features.\n\n6. Search data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains: This refers to a tool or service that allows users to search and retrieve specific data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains. This could include searching for specific transactions, addresses, or blocks, and retrieving relevant information related to them.\n\nNow, let's move on to the Simplicity code explanation:\n\nSimplicity is a programming language that is used to write code for blockchain programs. It is different from most programming languages because it is built using combinators, which are small building blocks that can be combined to create more complex expressions.\n\nThe first example of Simplicity code provided is a simple program called \"main,\" which takes an empty input and produces an empty output. It represents a function that doesn't do anything meaningful but serves as a starting point to understand how Simplicity code is constructed.\n\nThe second example shows a more interesting code that takes a bit and inverts it. In programming languages, side effects are used to interact with the outside world, such as spending a transaction. In Simplicity, bit inversion can be done using specific code, but it can also be simplified using a predefined shortcut called \"jet_not.\"\n\nThe text explains that in practice, most Simplicity code will be written once and then reused. The code for simple operations like bit inversion is already built into the language, making it easier for developers to write their own code without having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nThe text also mentions that eventually, most blockchain programs will not be written directly in Simplicity but in higher-level languages that compile down to Simplicity code. These higher-level languages will include proofs of their correct operation, ensuring the reliability and security of the programs.\n\nThe text then introduces the concept of programs in Simplicity. Programs are Simplicity expressions that have trivial input and output values. Only one function exists that maps a trivial input to a trivial output, making these expressions useful for certain purposes.\n\nThe strategy mentioned involves using Simplicity programs with holes, which are filled in when coins are spent, and programs with side effects, allowing them to access blockchain data or abort the program early. Holes can be specified using the \"disconnect\" and \"witness\" combinators. Witnesses are values of a given type (such as digital signatures or hash preimages) that serve as inputs to the program. Assertions, which halt program execution, are used to specify side effects.\n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that Simplicity has more combinators and jets (shortcuts for commonly used code) that will be discussed in future posts. It also mentions the concept of sharing, where identical expressions can be merged into one, and the subtleties related to what it means to be \"identical.\"\n\nHopefully, this detailed explanation helps you understand the concepts described in the text. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!",

      "summary": "Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. A two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains: This refers to a system that allows Bitcoin (BTC) to be transferred between the Bitcoin blockchain and other blockchain networks. It establishes a connection or bridge between these chains, enabling the transfer of BTC across different blockchains.\n\n2. Perpetual one-way peg: In a traditional one-way peg, BTC is transferred from the Bitcoin blockchain to another chain, but it cannot be transferred back. In a perpetual one-way peg, the BTC is burned or made unusable on the Bitcoin blockchain and can never be returned.\n\n3. Two-way peg with locked BTC: Instead of burning the BTC in a perpetual one-way peg, the BTC is locked up or made unspendable until a specific time, which in this case is 20 years in the future.\n\n4. Peg-outs: The process of moving BTC from the locked state back to the Bitcoin blockchain or another chain is called the peg-out. It refers to unlocking the BTC and making it spendable again.\n\n5. OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity: These are likely reference to cryptographic operations or programming languages used to provide zero-knowledge proof verification. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove the knowledge of some information to another party without revealing the actual information itself.\n\n6. OP_NOP10: This is an opcode (operation code) in Bitcoin's scripting language. Originally it was marked as a \"reserved\" opcode, meaning it was not yet in use. The statement \"We simply pretend that OP_NOP10 is OP_ZKP_VERIFY\" suggests that they are repurposing OP_NOP10 to act as OP_ZKP_VERIFY for the purposes of this script.\n\n7. OP_CLTV: This is another opcode that stands for \"Check Lock Time Verify.\" It allows a transaction to be spendable only after a certain time (in this case, 20 years) has passed since it was added to the blockchain.\n\n8. OP_2DROP: This opcode discards the top two items from the stack. In this context, it is used to ensure that the script discards unnecessary data or variables before continuing with the execution.\n\nThe goal of this design is to incentivize users to lock their BTC in the script by making it unspendable for 20 years. To unlock the BTC before the time period, the community needs to solve the problem of peg-outs using concepts like OP_ZKP_VERIFY. This idea was developed by Burak, with contributions from Super Testnet and another person named Jeremy Rubin, who had a similar idea related to Taproot activation (a proposed Bitcoin upgrade).",
      "summaryeli15": "At a high level, a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains is a mechanism that allows users to transfer Bitcoin (BTC) to another blockchain, and then transfer it back to the original Bitcoin blockchain at a later time. This process is similar to a perpetual one-way peg, where BTC is burned or permanently moved to another chain, but in this case, the BTC is locked up for a specific period, in this case, 20 years.\n\nTo implement this mechanism, the community needs to come up with a way to perform peg-outs, which are the process of transferring BTC from the other chain back to the Bitcoin blockchain. This can be done using a method called OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity, which are cryptographic techniques that enable verification of certain conditions.\n\nIn this specific explanation, the community decides to use a pseudo-operation called OP_ZKP_VERIFY, which is essentially a stand-in for a more advanced cryptographic operation. This operation is designed to read certain data from the stack, which is part of the Bitcoin script language used to encode transactions. It also requires some additional data provided in the unlocking script, which is used to prove ownership and authorization.\n\nTo lock BTC in this mechanism, users would use a script that includes the OP_ZKP_VERIFY operation, pretending that the actual OP_NOP10 (no operation) operation is the desired OP_ZKP_VERIFY operation. By locking BTC in this script, users contribute to the overall pool of locked funds, which creates a higher incentive for the community to find a solution to enable peg-outs.\n\nThe idea for this mechanism was initially proposed by someone named Burak, with additional contributions from Super Testnet and another person called I. Together, they worked on developing and documenting the concept. It is worth noting that this idea is similar to Jeremy Rubin's concept of betting on Taproot activation, which is another mechanism related to Bitcoin's underlying technology.\n\nThe specific script mentioned includes the OP_NOP10 and OP_CLTV operations, which are part of the Bitcoin script language. The OP_2DROP operation is used to remove the top two items from the stack in the script, essentially discarding them.",
