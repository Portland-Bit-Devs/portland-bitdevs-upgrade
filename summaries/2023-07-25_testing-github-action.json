      "summary": "This email is an announcement from Michael Ford via the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The email states that Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available and provides the link where it can be downloaded from (https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/). It also mentions that the code is available on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/full-rbf-v25.0. The code can be cloned using the command \"git clone -b full-rbf-v25.0 https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git\".\n\nThe purpose of this release is to introduce Antoine Riard's full-rbf (replace-by-fee) peering code along with some additional minor updates. The full-rbf code has two main functions for nodes running it: \n\n1) It advertises a FULL_RBF service bit when the mempoolfullrbf flag is set to 1. This allows other nodes to know that this node supports full-rbf transactions and can propagate them accordingly.\n\n2) It connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. By doing this, a core group of nodes is established to reliably propagate full-rbf replacements. It is suggested that not everyone needs to run this version, but it would be helpful if more people did.\n\nTo understand why you should choose to run the full-rbf version, the email provides a link to a blog post written by Peter Todd, titled \"Why You Should Run Mempoolfullrbf\" (https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf).\n\nThe email ends with a playful mention of having hats related to this release and includes a link to a tweet by Peter Todd showing the hats (https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1659996011086110720/photo/1).\n\nFurthermore, an attachment named \"signature.asc\" is mentioned, but no further details are provided about it.",
      "summaryeli15": "This message is an announcement about a new version of Bitcoin Core, specifically version 25.0. Bitcoin Core is a software program that helps run the Bitcoin network and allows users to send and receive Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe new version, v25.0, includes an additional feature called Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, along with some other minor updates. \"Full-rbf\" stands for \"full replace-by-fee,\" which is a way to change a Bitcoin transaction that has already been sent and replace it with a new one that has a higher fee. This can be useful in situations where a transaction is taking too long to confirm and the user wants it to be processed faster.\n\nThe addition of the full-rbf peering code does two things for nodes that have this feature enabled. First, it advertises a service bit called \"FULL_RBF\" when the setting \"mempoolfullrbf=1\" is activated. This means that the node is capable of processing and propagating full-rbf replacements. Second, it connects to four additional nodes that also support full-rbf, creating a core group of nodes that reliably propagate these replacements.\n\nIt is not necessary for everyone to run this version of Bitcoin Core with full-rbf. However, it would be helpful if more people did, as it contributes to the overall reliability and effectiveness of full-rbf transactions in the Bitcoin network.\n\nIf you're curious about why you should run full-rbf, you can read a blog post by Peter Todd, one of the developers involved in this update. The blog post discusses the benefits and reasons behind using full-rbf.\n\nAdditionally, there is a link to a tweet by Peter Todd, where he shares a picture of hats related to this update.",

      "summary": "The LNP/BP Standards Association recently released a smart contract system called RGB. In previous discussions, they mentioned that client-side validation has the potential to upgrade the Bitcoin layer 1 blockchain, which has been causing scalability and privacy issues for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nClient-side validation involves implementing a consensus protocol and a layer 1 for proof of publication. However, this layer can be implemented in a more efficient way than the current Bitcoin blockchain. The association introduces \"Prime,\" which is a proposal to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol with a new, scalable, and fully anonymous (opaque) layer 1. This upgrade aims to move most validation work into the client-side validation system, while keeping Bitcoin as money and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem intact.\n\nThe deployment of Prime doesn't require a softfork or miners' upgrade but can still benefit from them. Users who are not willing to upgrade will not be affected, and the initial deployment doesn't require any consensus or majority. Additionally, Prime makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant.\n\nPrime also addresses certain limitations in the current Bitcoin ecosystem. It aims to make activities such as BRC20, inscriptions, ordinals, etc., impossible. Instead, proper assets like NFTs will be handled through RGB smart contracts, removing the need for non-users to store, validate, and use their network bandwidth for third-party interests.\n\nThe white paper describing the Prime proposal can be found at the provided GitHub link. The LNP/BP Standards Association is forming a working group to focus on formally specifying and implementing this new layer. They welcome collaboration from anyone interested in this topic. The association also plans educational and workshop activities to help the community understand the underlying technology better and make informed decisions regarding its adoption.\n\nThe association believes that managing this infrastructural effort should not be entrusted to a for-profit company or commercial group with their own interests. Instead, they propose funding the effort through non-profit donations. They plan to launch a fundraising campaign, and those interested in contributing to the evolution of Bitcoin are encouraged to contact them. For-profit organizations can also become members of the association and participate in shaping the future of Bitcoin technologies through committee involvement.\n\nOverall, the LNP/BP Standards Association is proposing Prime as a scalable and anonymous upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol, leveraging client-side validation to address the limitations of the current blockchain.",

      "summary": "In this email thread, Salvatore Ingala discusses the MATT proposal for smart contracts in Bitcoin. He begins by explaining that MATT allows arbitrary smart contracts thanks to fraud proofs. The core opcodes of MATT are OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY and OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY.\n\nOP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY is used to verify that the current input's internal key contains some embedded data. It checks if the embedded data, typically passed through the witness stack, matches the commitment made by the internal key.\n\nOP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY is used to verify that a given output is a certain Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) output script containing the desired embedded data. It checks if the output's script contains the correct commitment to the embedded data and the merkle root of the taptree.\n\nSalvatore explains that MATT is not yet fully formalized and is still a work in progress. He compares MATT to other covenant proposals like APO, OP_CTV, and OP_VAULT, stating that MATT is smaller and easier to audit than those proposals.\n\nHe also discusses the relationship between MATT and Simplicity, a proposed better language to replace Script in Bitcoin. Salvatore believes that the engineering required for a soft-fork to implement MATT is straightforward and doesn't require waiting for Simplicity.\n\nSalvatore then goes on to explain how MATT can be used to create vaults similar to those built with OP_VAULT. He outlines the structure and parameters of a vault, including the use of alternate public keys, spend delays, and recovery public keys. He provides examples of P2TR structures for vaults in both the vault and unvaulting states.\n\nSalvatore concludes by stating that the MATT proposal offers a simpler and more flexible approach to vaults compared to OP_VAULT. He invites comments and feedback on the proposal.",
      "summaryeli15": "The post you provided is discussing a proposal called MATT (Minimal Anti-cheat Treaty) for implementing smart contracts in Bitcoin. The author of the post is explaining the core functionality of MATT and its potential use cases.\n\nMATT introduces two new opcodes called OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY and OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY. These opcodes allow for additional functionality in Bitcoin's scripting system. Specifically, they enable the ability to embed data in an output and specify its script, as well as read the embedded data in the current UTXO (unspent transaction output).\n\nThe author mentions that MATT can be seen as an alternative to other proposals like APO, CTV, and OP_VAULT, which also aim to add new functionality to Bitcoin's scripting system. However, MATT is considered simpler and easier to analyze compared to these other proposals.\n\nIn terms of functionality, MATT allows for introspection, meaning that you can check if the script of an input or output matches a certain value. This is not possible with Bitcoin's current scripting system. The author also mentions that MATT can enable arbitrary smart contracts through the use of fraud proofs. Fraud proofs are advanced applications of the new opcodes that allow for the detection and prevention of fraud in smart contracts.\n\nThe author also discusses the relationship between MATT and Simplicity, another proposal for improving Bitcoin's scripting system. The author states that MATT is independent of Simplicity and can be implemented without waiting for Simplicity. However, if the desired features of MATT are not needed, then the decision to implement Simplicity would be based on other considerations, such as potential risks to Bitcoin's network caused by the new features.\n\nThe post includes code examples and explanations of how MATT can be used to create vaults, which are a specific type of smart contract. The code examples demonstrate how MATT can be used to build vaults that are comparable to those built with OP_VAULT, another proposal for implementing vaults in Bitcoin. The author explains the structure and parameters of the vaults, as well as their scripts and opcodes.\n\nOverall, the post provides a detailed explanation of MATT and its potential applications in Bitcoin's scripting system.

      "summary": "In this message, the author is discussing the current status of the taproot annex and proposing a strategy for its utilization in the absence of a standardized format. \n\nThe taproot annex is currently considered consensus valid but non-standard. This means that although there is general agreement among participants in the Bitcoin network about its validity, it is not yet officially recognized as a standardized feature.\n\nThe author talks about ongoing conversations regarding the standardization of the taproot annex, and mentions that there seems to be a leaning towards adopting a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. TLV is a common data encoding scheme that allows for the representation of various types of data.\n\nHowever, the author points out that agreeing on an exact TLV format may take a significant amount of time. In the meantime, they argue that the benefits of making the taproot annex available in a non-structured form are immediate and evident. By allowing developers to use the annex without delay, they can take advantage of its features right now, instead of waiting for a lengthy standardization process.\n\nTo implement this approach, the author proposes defining any annex that begins with '0' as free-form, without any additional constraints. This means that developers can use the annex however they see fit, without adhering to a specific structure or format.\n\nThere are several advantages to this strategy. Firstly, it allows for immediate utilization of the taproot annex, enabling developers to use it for various applications right away. This eliminates the need to wait for the implementation of a structured format like TLV.\n\nSecondly, assigning '0'-beginning annexes as free-form keeps the options open for future developments and improvements. By not setting the structure of the annex in stone prematurely, it ensures that the Bitcoin network can adapt to changes and advancements in the industry.\n\nLastly, non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a probable TLV format. In a TLV format, the length of the data needs to be encoded, even if there is only a single field. Using non-structured data can potentially improve efficiency on the Chainspace (Bitcoin network) by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.\n\nIn conclusion, the author believes that adopting this approach of allowing free-form taproot annexes with a '0' beginning is a pragmatic and efficient route. It broadens the utilization scope of the annex immediately while preserving the possibility of transitioning to a more structured format in the future. They believe it can provide substantial benefits in both the short and long term.",

In the meantime, it is suggested that the annex be made available in a non-structured form.\n\nThe proposal is to define any annex that starts with the digit 0 as free-form, meaning it can be used without any additional constraints. This has several benefits:\n\n1. Immediate utilization: By allowing developers to use the taproot annex without delay, its features can be utilized today without waiting for the implementation of a more extensive standardization process using a structured format like TLV.\n\n2. Future flexibility: By keeping \"0\"-beginning annexes as free-form, it ensures that options for future developments and improvements in structure remain open. This strategy prevents prematurely setting the structure in stone and allows for more adaptability as the standardization process progresses.\n\n3. Chainspace efficiency: Non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a TLV format, which would require the encoding of length even for a single field. This can lead to more efficient data usage in the blockchain.\n\nIn conclusion, implementing this approach will expand the usability of the taproot annex immediately while still leaving room for a transition to a more structured format in the future.

      "summary": "The author begins by stating that they do not necessarily support the idea they are about to present, but they find it interesting enough to discuss and possibly inspire different use cases or stimulate debate.\n\nThe idea revolves around finding a more preferable and efficient way to transmit transaction packages to miners when peer-to-peer (p2p) package relay is still under development. They present a scenario where there is a parent transaction A that has a fee rate of 0 sat/b (satoshi per byte), such as a lightning commitment transaction, and a fee bumping child transaction B. Currently, these transactions are unable to reach miners.\n\nTo address this limitation, the author proposes a workaround involving a third transaction, C. Transaction C would be specifically crafted to contain the raw transactions A and B within a taproot annex. Alternatively, a commit/reveal style inscription could be used, but the author believes it would be more complex and less efficient.\n\nIn order to ensure propagation, transaction C would include sufficient fees. Additionally, it needs to use at least one of the same fee-contributing inputs as transaction B, but not any inputs from transaction A. When miners receive transaction C, they would be able to detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and promptly submit them to their mempool as a transaction package.\n\nThis newly formed transaction package (A+B) would then replace transaction C and could potentially be included in a block for mining. It is crucial to make sure that the combined package of transactions A+B is more appealing to miners than transaction C. The added weight of the embedded transactions in transaction C aids in achieving this goal.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that the fees for transaction C will never be paid because it has been replaced. Therefore, there are no additional costs associated with using this package relay scheme, unless the weight of A+B is very low and B needs to pay a higher fee rate than necessary to ensure the replacement of transaction C.\n\nHowever, if not all miners adopt this incentive-compatible replacement, there is a possibility that transaction C could still be mined. This likelihood decreases if the fee rate for transaction C is kept as minimal as possible. If transaction C is indeed mined, the operation can be retried with modified transactions B and C, although the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.\n\nIn conclusion, the author presents this idea as a potential solution to transmit transaction packages to miners while p2p package relay is under development. They acknowledge the possible drawbacks and uncertainties associated with this approach but believe it is worth discussing and exploring further.",
      "summaryeli15": "The idea being presented here is called out-of-band relay, and it suggests an alternative method for getting transaction packages to miners in a more efficient way, while another method called p2p package relay is still under development.\n\nTo understand this concept, let's consider a scenario where we have a parent transaction called A, which has a fee of 0 sat/b (basically no fee), and a child transaction called B. Currently, these transactions cannot reach the miners and be included in the blockchain.\n\nThe proposed workaround involves introducing a third transaction called C. Transaction C would be created specifically to contain the raw transactions A and B within a taproot annex. Instead of using a more complicated and less efficient commit/reveal style inscription, it is suggested to include A and B directly within C.\n\nTo ensure that transaction C propagates through the network, it would need to pay sufficient fees. Additionally, at least one of the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B would be used in transaction C, but not any inputs from transaction A.\n\nWhen miners receive transaction C, they can detect the embedded transactions A and B within the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. This package, consisting of transactions A and B, would then replace transaction C and can be included in a block for mining.\n\nIt is important to make sure that the combined package of A and B is more attractive to miners than the original C transaction. The extra weight of the embedded transactions in C helps with this. Additionally, the fees for transaction C would never be paid because it has been replaced. So, using this package relay scheme wouldn't result in any extra costs, unless the weight of A and B is very low and B needs to pay a higher fee rate than necessary to ensure the replacement of C.\n\nIf not all miners adopt this incentive-compatible replacement, there is a chance that transaction C might still end up being mined. However, keeping the fee rate for C at a minimum would make it less probable. If transaction C is indeed mined, the operation can be retried with a modified B and C, but the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal suggests using the out-of-band relay method with a specially crafted transaction containing embedded transactions to ensure that transaction packages reach miners efficiently. However, it is important to note that this idea may not be widely adopted and has its own risks and complexities.",

      "summary": "This message is an announcement regarding the submission of a Silent Payments BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for consideration and review. The BIP aims to address the limitations of current approaches related to maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe message begins by acknowledging the prolonged process of refining and tweaking the original write-up proposed by Ruben Somsen in March 2022. It provides links to the full specification and a work-in-progress implementation for Bitcoin Core for interested parties to review.\n\nThe main issue discussed in the BIP is the use of a new address for each Bitcoin transaction to ensure privacy. However, establishing secure interaction between the sender and receiver to obtain a fresh address is often challenging and sometimes undesirable. To overcome this, protocols have been proposed that use a static payment address and rely on blockchain notifications. While these protocols eliminate the need for interaction, they come at the cost of increased costs for one-time payments and leave a noticeable footprint in the blockchain, potentially revealing metadata about the sender and receiver. Moreover, notification schemes may compromise sender privacy by allowing the receiver to link multiple payments from the same sender.\n\nThe proposal aims to solve these limitations by introducing a solution that eliminates the need for interaction and notifications, while protecting the privacy of both the sender and receiver. However, this solution requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which is generally feasible for full nodes but poses challenges for light clients.\n\nThe goals of the proposed protocol are outlined, including no increase in transaction size or cost, blending resulting transactions with other bitcoin transactions, ensuring transactions cannot be linked to a silent payment address by outside observers, eliminating the need for sender-receiver interaction, preventing multiple payments from being linked to the same sender, avoiding accidental address reuse, supporting payment labeling, using existing seed phrase or descriptor methods for backup and recovery, separating scanning and spending responsibilities, being compatible with other spending protocols like CoinJoin, providing light client/SPV wallet support, and allowing for protocol upgrades.\n\nThe message then proceeds to provide an overview of the protocol, explaining different aspects with the help of examples and pseudocode. It covers various scenarios, including creating a single output, creating multiple outputs, preventing address reuse, handling multiple inputs, using a spend and scan key, implementing labels for payments, and managing change outputs.\n\nThe message concludes by stating the importance of keeping the change label secret to prevent others from labeling payments as change. It also mentions that it was sent with Proton Mail secure email and includes additional attachments related to the sender.\n\nOverall, this message provides a detailed introduction to a proposed Silent Payments BIP, outlining its objectives, key features, and the rationale behind it. It also provides links to access the full specification and implementation for those interested in more technical details.",
      "summaryeli15": "This write-up is discussing a proposal called Silent Payments, which aims to address privacy concerns in Bitcoin transactions. When making a Bitcoin transaction, it is important to use a new address each time to maintain privacy. However, this often requires interaction between the sender and receiver to establish a new address, which may not always be feasible or desired.\n\nTo solve this problem, various protocols have been proposed that use a static payment address and notifications sent via the blockchain. These protocols eliminate the need for interaction but come with increased costs for one-time payments and a noticeable footprint in the blockchain, which can reveal metadata about the sender and receiver. These notification schemes also allow the receiver to link all payments from the same sender, compromising sender privacy.\n\nThe Silent Payments proposal aims to address the limitations of these current approaches by presenting a solution that eliminates the need for interaction, notifications, and protects both sender and receiver privacy. However, this solution requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which is feasible for full nodes but poses a challenge for light clients.\n\nThe goals of the Silent Payments protocol are as follows:\n\n1. No increase in the size or cost of transactions.\n2. Resulting transactions blend in with other bitcoin transactions and cannot be distinguished.\n3. Transactions cannot be linked to a silent payment address by an outside observer.\n4. No sender-receiver interaction is required.\n5. No linking of multiple payments to the same sender.\n6.

The protocol is upgradeable.\n\nThe overview of the protocol is then presented, explaining the different aspects of how Silent Payments work. It describes a simple case where a sender (Alice) discovers a silent payment address published by the receiver (Bob). Alice selects a UTXO (unspent transaction output) with her private key and creates a destination output for Bob. The process involves cryptographic calculations using public and private keys.\n\nThe overview also explains how multiple outputs can be created for Bob, preventing address reuse, and how all inputs in a transaction can be used instead of picking a specific one. It discusses the concept of a spend and scan key, which allows Bob to keep his private key exposed to an online device minimally and perform scanning using a different public key.\n\nThe overview also introduces the idea of labels, where Bob can differentiate incoming payments to a single silent payment address. It explains how labels can be used for change outputs, allowing Bob to manage his own change addresses.\n\nOverall, the Silent Payments proposal aims to provide a privacy-preserving solution for Bitcoin transactions without the need for interaction, notifications, and compromising sender and receiver privacy.",

      "summary": "In this message, the author, ThomasV, is proposing an extension to BOLT-11, a protocol specification for Lightning Network invoices. The proposed extension involves allowing an invoice to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts.\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to address a specific use case where services require the prepayment of a mining fee to facilitate non-custodial exchanges. Two examples given are submarine swaps and JIT (Just-In-Time) channels.\n\nIn both cases, the service provider receives a Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage. They need to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. However, there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, so the service providers ask for a prepayment of mining fees to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe problem arises when services, like Boltz exchange, use a website to show an invoice to the user. It would be impractical for them to show two invoices to be paid simultaneously. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can force them to pay on-chain fees, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n\nSimilarly, for JIT channels, providers need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel to protect themselves against mining fee attacks. However, asking for the preimage first makes the service custodian, which has legal implications under the European MICA regulation.\n\nTo address these issues, ThomasV proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments would involve waiting for all HTLCs (from both payments) to arrive before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, the prepayment should be failed with a Multipath Payment (MPP) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver can fulfill the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcast their on-chain transaction. It should be noted that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage.\n\nIt is acknowledged that this proposal does not prevent the service provider from stealing the prepayment, as that is already a possibility. However, it would level the playing field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, competitors without an established user base running a dedicated client are vulnerable to the mining fee attack.\n\nIn addition to benefiting other lightning service providers, ThomasV believes ACINQ would also benefit from this change by making their pay-to-open service fully non-custodial. The current pay-to-open service used by Phoenix is likely to fall under the scope of the European MICA regulation, which can be a serious issue.\n\nFinally, ThomasV suggests that this change should be implemented within BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be achieved in a non-interactive way, making the process simpler and more efficient.\n\nOverall, the proposal aims to enhance the functionality of BOLT-11 invoices to better accommodate the specific use case of prepayment for mining fees in non-custodial exchanges.",
      "summaryeli15": "Good morning! It seems like you're interested in understanding a proposal to extend BOLT-11, which is a specification for Lightning Network invoices. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe proposal suggests adding a feature to BOLT-11 invoices where two bundled payments can be included. These bundled payments have distinct preimages (unique identification codes) and amounts. This extension is aimed at addressing a specific use case: when services require a prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place.\n\nTwo examples of such services are \"submarine swaps\" and \"JIT channels.\" In both cases, the service provider receives a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) payment for which they do not have the preimage (the unique identification code needed to claim the payment). Instead, they have to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment.\n\nHowever, since there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, service providers often ask for a prepayment of mining fees. This is to protect themselves in case the payment is never claimed. For example, services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for a prepayment because their software can handle it. This is known as a \"no show penalty.\" But competitors who don't require dedicated software, like the Boltz exchange, are unable to do this. This creates a vulnerability for Boltz as they can be targeted by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where an attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees.\n\nIn the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. This essentially makes them a custodian of the funds. From a legal perspective, this becomes problematic as custodial services fall within the scope of European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, like Electrum, are therefore excluded from this game.\n\nTo address these issues, the proposal suggests bundling the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. Here's how the bundled payments would work:\n\n1. The BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: the prepayment and the main payment.\n\n2. The receiver (service provider) should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the prepayment with a MPP (multi-part payment) timeout.\n\n3. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. It's important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.\n\nAlthough this proposal doesn't prevent the service provider from stealing the prepayment (which is already a possibility), it aims to level the playing field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, only those who use a dedicated client like Loop can ask for prepayments, while others are exposed to the mining fee attack. ACINQ, another lightning service provider, would benefit from this change as well, as they would be able to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. At present, it falls within the scope of European MICA regulation, which is considered a serious issue.\n\nThe proposal suggests implementing this change in BOLT-11 itself, rather than introducing new specifications like BOLT-12 or onion messages. The reasoning behind this is to keep things simple and avoid adding unnecessary complexity. By using a non-interactive approach, where no new messages need to be exchanged, the proposal aims to address the identified use case effectively.\n\nI hope this provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposal. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!",

      "summary": "The PR (Pull Request) branch HEAD refers to the specific commit or version of the code that is being reviewed. In this case, the commit with the code version was 0538ad7 at the time of the review club meeting.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a transaction state. This transaction state helps the wallet determine which transactions the user can spend and counts towards the user's balance. The detailed information about these transaction states is provided in a document (not specified in the given context).\n\nThe previous discussion about wallet transaction states and conflicts was held in review club #27145. The specifics of this discussion are not mentioned.\n\nOn the master branch (the main development branch), wallet transactions are considered conflicted only when the conflicting transaction is included in a mined block. If a transaction is only conflicted by a transaction in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), it is considered inactive instead. This can be confusing for users because it temporarily makes the funds \"disappear.\"\n\nThis PR aims to treat transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. It introduces another transaction state specifically for mempool-conflicted transactions. The PR also keeps track of the conflicting transactions in a data structure called MempoolConflicts, which is a map that associates wallet transaction hashes with sets of their mempool conflict transaction hashes.\n\nThe reviewer is asked about their assessment of the PR. The terms \"Concept ACK,\" \"approach ACK,\" \"tested ACK,\" and \"NACK\" are not defined in the given context. They are likely review statuses indicating various levels of approval or disapproval.\n\nThe PR is either fixing a bug or adding a feature, but the exact nature of the bug/feature is not mentioned.\n\nThe trade-off of considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted instead of inactive is not explicitly stated. However, one potential trade-off could be that considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted might provide more accurate information to users, but it may also create more complexity in the code and potentially increase the risk of false positives.\n\nThe first commit in the PR is mentioned, but its necessity or impact on existing behavior is not specified. It is unclear if it changes any existing behavior.\n\nThe purpose of adding a MempoolConflicts map is to keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool for each wallet transaction. This map allows the wallet to easily access and manage the conflicts. Checking for conflicts in mapTxSpends alone may not be sufficient as it might not provide the necessary information about the conflicting transactions in the mempool.\n\nAdding another transaction state, TxStateMempoolConflicted, instead of just using TxStateConflicted likely provides more granular information about the status of a transaction. This allows for better classification and handling of mempool-conflicted transactions separately from other types of conflicts.\n\nWhether a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict is not specifically addressed. However, it is implied that this PR enables the user to abandon such a transaction.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, the transaction state of a previously mempool-conflicted transaction is not mentioned. It is possible that the transaction state would be retained, but without further details, it cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nThe tests added to wallet_conflicts.py are not specified to fail on the master branch. Therefore, it can be assumed that these tests do not fail on the master branch.\n\nAlthough this PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made in this PR can indirectly affect the balance calculation of the wallet. By treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted, the balance calculation may include or exclude these transactions, depending on the specific implementation.\n\nTxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not explicitly mentioned to be treated the same in memory. However, given that they have different transaction states, it can be inferred that they are treated differently in memory and have different implications for the wallet's behavior.\n\nThe need for implementing additional test cases is not addressed. It is suggested that the reviewer can propose any additional test cases they would like to see implemented.\n\nThe reason wallet_abandonconflict.py needs to be modified in the second commit is not specified in the given context. The rationale for this modification may be explained in the PR or associated documentation.",
      "summaryeli15": "The information provided is related to a specific software development project, likely involving Bitcoin Core. Here is a detailed explanation of the given information:\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, the PR (pull request) branch HEAD (the latest commit on the branch) was identified by the commit hash \"0538ad7\" at the time of the review club meeting. This means that the developers were discussing and reviewing the changes made in this particular commit.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin Core wallets, each transaction has a specific state that determines how the wallet treats and handles it. These transaction states play a role in deciding which transactions can be spent by the user and which transactions are considered part of the user's balance.\n\nThe concept of transaction states and conflicts was previously discussed in review club #27145. The developers were likely discussing the issues and potential improvements related to how conflicting transactions are handled within the wallet.\n\nOn the master branch (the main development branch), transactions in the wallet are only considered conflicted when the conflicting transaction is included in a mined block on the Bitcoin network. However, if a transaction only conflicts with another transaction in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), it is considered as \"TxStateInactive\" instead. This can sometimes confuse users because their funds may appear to temporarily disappear.\n\nThe pull request being reviewed in the PR treats transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. This is achieved by adding another transaction state called \"TxStateMempoolConflicted\" and keeping track of the conflicting transactions in a data structure called \"MempoolConflicts.\" This data structure is essentially a map that associates wallet transaction hashes with sets of hashes representing their conflicting transactions in the mempool.\n\nThe reviewer of the pull request is asked if they have reviewed it and if so, whether they approve of the concept (Concept ACK), the approach taken (approach ACK), if they have tested the changes (tested ACK), or if they do not approve (NACK). This helps gauge the reviewer's overall feedback and assessment of the changes.\n\nRegarding the bug/feature aspect of the PR, it is not explicitly mentioned in the given information. However, it is likely that this pull request is fixing a bug related to how conflicts in the mempool are handled and providing the feature of treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted.\n\nOne trade-off of considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted instead of inactive is that it may lead to confusion for users, as mentioned earlier. The funds associated with a mempool-conflicted transaction might temporarily disappear from the user's balance, even though they are still present in the mempool. This can cause unintended user experience issues. However, treating such transactions as conflicted provides a more consistent approach and avoids potential discrepancies.\n\nThe first commit in the pull request is not explicitly discussed, so it is unclear whether it is necessary for the PR or if it changes any existing behavior. Further information would be needed to answer this question accurately.\n\nAdding a MempoolConflicts map serves the purpose of keeping track of which wallet transactions have conflicts with transactions in the mempool. This information is necessary for determining the transaction state and handling conflicted transactions appropriately. The wallet cannot solely rely on the existing mapTxSpends mechanism to identify conflicts in the mempool.\n\nThe benefit of adding another transaction state, TxStateMempoolConflicted, instead of using TxStateConflicted is likely for better categorization and clarity. By having a separate state for mempool conflicts, the wallet code can specifically address the differences and handle such transactions more accurately.\n\nWith this PR, it is not explicitly mentioned whether a user can abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. Further information would be required to answer this question.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, the transaction state of a previously mempool-conflicted transaction will likely depend on the implementation details of the PR. It could potentially remain in the TxStateMempoolConflicted state or transition to another relevant state based on the changes made.\n\nThe tests added to the wallet_conflicts.py file are not explicitly mentioned as passing or failing on the master branch. It is unclear whether these tests are already implemented on the master branch or if they are new tests added in the PR.\n\nAlthough this PR doesn't directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made in this PR will likely impact the balance calculation logic indirectly. By treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted, it might affect how the wallet considers and incorporates such transactions in the balance calculation process.\n\nIt is unclear from the provided information whether TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are treated the same in memory. Additional details would be necessary to answer this question accurately.\n\nRegarding additional test cases, it is not mentioned if the reviewer has any specific suggestions for further test cases that they would like to see implemented. This question could potentially be asked to gather the reviewer's input.\n\nThe reason for modifying the wallet_abandonconflict.py file in the second commit is not discussed in the provided information. Further details would be required to understand the specific changes made to this file and why they are necessary.",

      "summary": "The given statement is referring to a specific version of a Pull Request (PR) in a software development project, specifically the PR branch with the commit ID \"d25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487\". This PR is a follow-up to another PR with the number 25325, which was reviewed on March 8 of the current year. It is recommended to review the notes from that review.\n\nThe -dbcache configuration option in the project determines the amount of memory used for the cache of coins and other database-related memory usages. By default, it is set to 450 MiB (Mebibytes). The function \"CalculateCacheSizes()\" is responsible for determining the memory allocation for the coins cache.\n\nUsing less memory than the default can result in a decrease in the cache hit ratio, which represents the fraction of lookups that are successful in finding the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) in the cache. On the other hand, using more memory than specified can lead to memory restrictions and crash the bitcoind software.\n\nTo maintain an accurate record of the memory used by the cache, it is crucial to keep track of the memory utilization. While the accounting doesn't have to be perfect, it should be reasonably close.\n\nWhen a program requests a certain amount of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, it internally allocates slightly more memory for the metadata (overhead) of the memory allocator. This means that logical memory (requested memory) is not the same as physical memory (actual allocated memory).\n\nThe metadata for memory allocation is complex and depends on various factors like the machine architecture and memory model.\n\nTo accurately determine the physical memory usage (accounting for the metadata overhead), logical memory size doesn't directly map to physical size. Consequently, Bitcoin Core includes a function named MallocUsage() to approximate the conversion between logical and physical memory. MallocUsage() takes the allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size.\n\nThe source file memusage.h contains multiple overloads of the function DynamicUsage() for different data types that might be allocated in the system. These overloads all rely on MallocUsage() to calculate their physical memory usage.\n\nThe PR #25325 introduced a new DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource. This new overload computes the total size of the coins cache, enabling the project to stay within the configured cache size.\n\nThe mentioned DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource is only called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the question inquires about the reviewing approach used. The possible options for the review are \"Concept ACK\" (the idea is good), \"Approach ACK\" (the implementation approach is good), \"Tested ACK\" (the changes have been tested and produce the expected results), or \"NACK\" (negative acknowledgment, meaning there are issues or problems).\n\nMoving on to the master branch (the main development branch without the PR in question), a comparison is made between two DynamicUsage() overloads. The question asks why the overload in question has many templated arguments compared to the overload immediately preceding it on line 170.\n\nThe DynamicUsage() overload on the master branch has multiple templated arguments to handle different data types that might be allocated. This allows for flexibility and generic calculation of memory usage across various allocations. The overload in question for this PR may have a different implementation because it relates specifically to the coins cache.\n\nThe question also asks how the DynamicUsage() overload on the master branch works before this PR. It is unclear without additional context from the code or comments, as the explanation provided doesn't contain details about the functionality or purpose of that overload.\n\nRegarding the values being added together in the PR, it is necessary to clarify which specific calculations are being referred to. The statement mentions that the calculation includes the m.bucket_count(), which is related to the number of buckets in a hash table. However, it questions why the memory for bucket allocation isn't already accounted for in the resource \"chunks.\" Without further information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to this question.\n\nIn the PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location, which is not mentioned in the given statement. Additionally, the necessity of m.bucket_count() is no longer evident based on the provided information. The advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() could be related to optimizations or design improvements made in the PR, but without specific details, it is impossible to give a definite answer.\n\nLastly, the \"extra credit\" question asks about cachedCoinsUsage and why it is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in the CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() function. Unfortunately, there is no information provided about cachedCoinsUsage, its purpose, or its relationship with memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()). Without further context, it is not possible to answer this question.",

The reviewer requests that you review the notes for that particular review club meeting before proceeding with the current review.\n\nThe -dbcache configuration option is responsible for determining the amount of memory allocated for the coins cache and other memory-related database uses. By default, this option assigns 450 MiB (Mebibytes) of memory for this purpose. The function CalculateCacheSizes() is involved in this process.\n\nIf you use less memory than what is allowed, the coins cache hit ratio may decrease. This means that a smaller fraction of lookups will successfully find the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) in the cache. On the other hand, using more memory than the specified limit can lead to crashes on systems with limited memory availability.\n\nIt is crucial to have an accurate estimation of the memory used by the cache. While it doesn't need to be perfect, it should be reasonably close to the actual usage.\n\nWhen a program requests a certain amount of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, it actually allocates slightly more due to metadata overhead. This metadata is necessary for the memory allocator and depends on factors such as the machine architecture and memory model.\n\nIn order to properly size the cache, it is essential to calculate the physical memory usage, taking into account this additional allocation metadata. However, there is no library function available that directly maps logical memory size to physical size.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage(), which approximates the conversion from logical size to physical size. It takes an allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size.\n\nThe source file memusage.h contains multiple overloads of the function DynamicUsage(), each dealing with different data types that may be allocated within the system. These overloads use the MallocUsage() function to perform their calculations.\n\nThe pool memory resource, introduced by PR #25325, adds a new overload of DynamicUsage() that calculates the overall size of the coins cache. This ensures that the cache remains within the configured size limits.\n\nThis specific DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource is only called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().\n\nThe reviewer is asking if you have reviewed the PR yet and, if so, what is your review approach? It could be a Concept ACK (acknowledgment), which means you agree with the general concept. It could also be an approach ACK, indicating that you agree with the approach taken in the PR. Alternatively, it could be a tested ACK, meaning you have tested the changes and agree with them. Finally, it could be a NACK, indicating that you have concerns or objections to the PR.\n\nIn the master branch (the version without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has multiple templated arguments. Comparing it to the overload immediately above it (on line 170), we can see that the number of arguments varies. The reasoning behind this difference may be explained in the code itself.\n\nIn the master branch, this DynamicUsage() overload works by adding up various values to calculate the overall memory usage. These values could include the sizes of different data structures or the memory used by specific parts of the code.\n\nRegarding m.bucket_count(), it is unclear why it is part of the DynamicUsage() calculation. It is possible that the memory allocated for bucket count is already accounted for in the resource \"chunks,\" so it doesn't need to be included separately.\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location, possibly in another file or function. As a result, m.bucket_count() is no longer needed, implying that it is redundant in the new implementation.\n\nThe advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() anymore could be that it simplifies the calculation process or that the same information is now obtained from a different source or data structure.\n\nAs for the extra credit question, cachedCoinsUsage represents the memory usage specifically related to the cached coins. In CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(), it is added to the overall memory usage calculation performed by memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()). This ensures that the memory used by the cached coins is properly considered in the total memory analysis.",

      "summary": "The given information describes a Pull Request (PR) in the libbitcoinkernel project, which aims to separate Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from other non-consensus modules in the codebase.\n\nAt the time of the review club meeting, the PR branch's HEAD (commit) was a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5.\n\nThe PR #27636 introduced a kernel::Notifications interface. This interface allows node implementations (such as KernelNotifications) to define the desired behavior for events. One specific event type is when the consensus engine needs to shut down, either expectedly or unexpectedly.\n\nTo allow nodes to implement the necessary behavior, the PR #27711 adds two new notification methods: kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError.\n\nIn addition, this PR also moves the shutdown files and the remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code, which started in the previous PR #27636.\n\nHere are the detailed answers to the questions:\n\n1. Review approach: The question asks for the review approach. Without further context, it is unclear what review approach is being referred to.\n\n2. Reason for startShutdown duplication: The question asks why the startShutdown method is present in both kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h. Without more information, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer. However, it is possible that the startShutdown method is defined in both files to ensure that it is accessible to different parts of the codebase.\n\n3. Role of fRequestShutdown: The fRequestShutdown mentioned is not further explained in the given information. It is related to terminating long-running kernel functions, but without details, its specific role cannot be elaborated.\n\n4. Contribution to decoupling: The notification interface contributes to the decoupling of non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel by providing a standardized interface for events. This allows node implementations to define their own behavior for these events without being tightly coupled to the consensus engine.\n\n5. Flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications: The given information does not provide specific details about the flow of these notifications. However, in general, startShutdown and fatalError notifications are triggered by the consensus engine or other components in the codebase. The producers of these notifications can be the consensus engine itself or other modules that detect the need for a shutdown or an error. The consumers of these notifications would be the node implementations that have defined behavior for these events.\n\n6. Potential race conditions or synchronization issues: Without a detailed analysis of the code, it is difficult to determine if there are potential race conditions or synchronization issues. However, the use of notification interfaces can introduce potential synchronization challenges when multiple threads or processes are involved. Careful design and implementation of the notification system should consider such issues and ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are in place.\n\n7. KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested: The given information does not provide details about the role or purpose of KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested. Without further explanation, it is not possible to accurately explain why it is a reference value. Regarding alternative approaches, it would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project. Different approaches could include using flags or enums to trigger a shutdown, signaling mechanisms between components, or event-driven architectures.\n\nIn summary, the given information provides a high-level overview of a PR in the libbitcoinkernel project. However, specific details are missing, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive explanation.",
      "summaryeli15": "At the time of this review club meeting, the PR branch HEAD was a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5. This means that the specific version of the code that was being discussed had a unique identifier or \"branch HEAD\" called a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5.\n\nThe libbitcoinkernel project is aimed at separating Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from other parts of the codebase that are not related to consensus, such as various indices. This allows for better organization and modularity. Previous Pull Requests (PRs) related to libbitcoinkernel have been covered in the past, specifically PRs #25527, #24410, and #20158.\n\nPR #27636 introduced a new interface called kernel::Notifications. This interface is meant to be implemented by different node implementations (e.g., KernelNotifications) to trigger specific behavior for different events. One type of event is when the consensus engine needs to shut down, whether it is expected or unexpected.\n\nPR #27711 expands on this by adding two new notification methods to the kernel::Notifications interface: kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods allow the node to implement the necessary behavior when a shutdown or fatal error occurs. Additionally, this PR moves the shutdown files and the remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code, as initiated in PR #27636.\n\nIn terms of reviewing the PR, there are different approaches: Concept ACK means that the reviewer agrees with the general concept or idea behind the PR, approach ACK means that the reviewer agrees with the implementation approach chosen, tested ACK means that the reviewer has tested the code and confirms its functionality, and NACK means that the reviewer disagrees with either the concept, approach, or has found issues with testing.\n\nThe presence of the startShutdown method in both the kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h files might seem redundant. However, the reason for this is that the kernel/notifications_interface.h file defines the interface with a generic implementation, while the node/kernel_notifications.h file provides a specific implementation for the node version. This separation allows for better organization and customization.\n\nThe fRequestShutdown variable is related to this PR as it plays a role in terminating long-running kernel functions. When this variable is set to true, it signifies that a shutdown has been requested, and the kernel functions should start terminating. It can be used in conjunction with the startShutdown notification method to trigger the shutdown process.\n\nThe notification interface, kernel::Notifications, contributes to the decoupling of non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel by providing a way for different node implementations to customize their behavior for various events. By separating the code that handles notifications from the consensus engine code, the non-consensus code becomes more modular and independent.\n\nIn this new setup, the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications involves producers and consumers. The producers are the parts of the code that call the kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError methods when the corresponding events occur, such as the consensus engine requiring a shutdown. The consumers are the node implementations that have implemented the kernel::Notifications interface and have determined the desired behavior for these events. They receive the notifications and execute the necessary actions accordingly.\n\nWhen using a notification interface, there is a possibility of race conditions or synchronization issues arising. For example, if multiple events occur simultaneously and trigger notifications, it may lead to conflicts or inconsistent behavior. To address this, proper synchronization mechanisms need to be put in place, such as using locks or atomic operations, to ensure that the notifications are handled correctly and without conflicts.\n\nThe KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested being a reference value means that it references the actual variable where the shutdown request state is stored. This allows for efficient and direct access to the variable, avoiding the need to make copies or perform excessive memory operations. As for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown, there could be variations depending on the specific use case or requirements. However, the use of a reference value is a common and efficient approach.",

      "summary": "In this week's newsletter, there is a discussion about extending BOLT11 invoices to request two payments. BOLT11 invoices are a lightning network protocol used to request payments. Thomas Voegtlin suggests that BOLT11 invoices should be extended to allow a receiver to request two separate payments from a spender, with each payment having a separate secret and amount.\n\nVoegtlin explains that this feature could be useful for submarine swaps and JIT (Just-In-Time) channels. Submarine swaps are a type of atomic swap where a user can trade on-chain funds for lightning network funds or vice versa. JIT channels are channels that are created on-demand and closed immediately after they are used.\n\nHowever, Voegtlin acknowledges that there are challenges with this approach. If the user doesn't disclose their secret, the receiver won't receive any compensation and will incur onchain costs for no gain. Existing JIT channel service providers require the user to disclose their secret before the funding transaction is secure, but this may create legal problems and prevent non-custodial wallets from offering a similar service.\n\nVoegtlin suggests that allowing a BOLT11 invoice to contain two separate commitments to secrets, each for a different amount, would solve these challenges. One secret and amount can be used for an upfront fee to pay the onchain transaction costs, and the other secret and amount can be used for the actual submarine swap or JIT channel funding.\n\nThe proposal received several comments. Matt Corallo mentions that it hasn't been possible to get all Lightning Network implementations to update their BOLT11 support to support invoices without an amount. Therefore, he believes adding an additional field to BOLT11 invoices is not a practical approach at this time. Bastien Teinturier suggests adding support to offers instead of invoices. However, Voegtlin disagrees and believes that adding support to BOLT11 is practical.\n\nThe discussion is still ongoing at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the discussion about BOLT11 invoices, the newsletter also includes a limited weekly series about mempool policy. The series covers topics such as transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explains why Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than allowed by consensus and how wallets can use that policy most effectively.\n\nThe newsletter also highlights updates to Bitcoin wallets and services. Some of the updates mentioned include the open-sourcing of Greenlight libraries, the announcement of the Tapsim script execution debugger, the release of Bitcoin Keeper 1.0.4 with coinjoin support, the announcement of the Lightning wallet EttaWallet, the announcement of BTC Warp, a light client sync proof-of-concept using zkSNARKs, and the release of lnprototest v0.0.4, a test suite for LN.\n\nFinally, the newsletter provides information about new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects. It encourages users to upgrade to new releases or help test release candidates.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers a variety of topics related to the Lightning Network, mempool policy, Bitcoin wallets and services, and updates to Bitcoin infrastructure software.",
      "summaryeli15": "This week's newsletter covers several topics related to Bitcoin. One of the main discussions is about extending BOLT11 invoices to allow for two payments. BOLT11 invoices are a standard format used in the Lightning Network for requesting payments. Thomas Voegtlin suggested that these invoices should be updated to allow a receiver to request two separate payments from a spender. Each payment would have its own secret and amount.\n\nThe idea behind this proposal is to enable the use of submarine swaps and JIT (Just-In-Time) channels. Submarine swaps are a method of exchanging onchain Bitcoin for Lightning Network Bitcoin, and JIT channels are a type of channel that can be opened and closed quickly. Currently, if a user doesn't disclose their secret in these scenarios, the service provider won't receive any compensation and will incur onchain costs for no gain.\n\nVoegtlin believes that existing JIT channel service providers avoid this problem by requiring the user to disclose their secret before the funding transaction is secure. However, he notes that this approach may create legal problems and prevent non-custodial wallets from offering a similar service.\n\nTo address this issue, Voegtlin suggests incorporating two separate commitments to secrets in a BOLT11 invoice. One secret and amount would be used for an upfront fee to cover onchain transaction costs, while the other secret and amount would be used for the actual submarine swap or JIT channel funding.\n\nThe proposal received several comments from other members of the Lightning-Dev mailing list. Some expressed concerns about the practicality and compatibility of implementing this change across all Lightning Network implementations. They argued that it would be challenging to get all LN implementations to support invoices without an amount, which is a prerequisite for allowing spontaneous payments. Others suggested adding support to offers instead. However, Voegtlin disagreed and believed that adding support for two separate payments in BOLT11 invoices is a practical approach.\n\nThe discussion on this proposal is ongoing at the time of writing, indicating that members of the Lightning-Dev community are actively engaged in exploring its feasibility and potential benefits.\n\nAnother topic covered in the newsletter is a limited weekly series about transaction relay, mempool policy, and mining transaction selection. It explains the importance of having consistent policies across the network to ensure smooth transaction propagation, fee estimation, and compact block relay.\n\nThe newsletter also includes updates on Bitcoin wallets and services. Some notable updates mentioned are the open sourcing of Greenlight libraries, the announcement of Tapscript debugger Tapsim, the release of Bitcoin Keeper 1.0.4 with coinjoin support, the announcement of Lightning wallet EttaWallet, the announcement of zkSNARK-based block header sync PoC, and the release of lnprototest v0.0.4, a test suite for Lightning Network implementations.\n\nLastly, the newsletter provides information on new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects, encouraging users to upgrade to new releases or help test release candidates.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers various discussions, updates, and proposals related to Bitcoin and its infrastructure, aimed at keeping the community informed and engaged.",

      "summary": "This week's newsletter provides a detailed summary of various topics related to Bitcoin. Let's break them down:\n\n1. Preventing coinjoin pinning with v3 transaction relay: The newsletter discusses a proposal made by Greg Sanders on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list. The proposal suggests using v3 transaction relay rules to prevent the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Pinning refers to a situation where one participant in a coinjoin transaction creates a conflicting transaction that prevents the coinjoin transaction from being confirmed. Sanders proposes a solution where each participant initially spends their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by either all participants in the coinjoin or by the participant after a timelock expires. This would require coordination and agreement among the participants or the participant and the coordinator. It is worth noting that this proposal has not yet received any discussion on the mailing list.\n\n2. Limited weekly series about mempool policy: The newsletter mentions an ongoing series about mempool policy, which focuses on transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explores topics such as why Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than allowed by consensus and how wallets can use that policy effectively. In a previous post, the series discussed protecting node resources and argued for the convergence on one policy to ensure scalability, upgradeability, and accessibility of maintaining a full node.\n\n3. Popular questions and answers on Bitcoin Stack Exchange: The newsletter highlights some of the top-voted questions and answers on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange since the last update. These questions cover a range of topics, including why Bitcoin nodes accept blocks that exclude anticipated transactions, why soft forks restrict the existing ruleset, the reason for the default Lightning Network channel limit, why Bitcoin Core uses ancestor score instead of just ancestor fee rate to select transactions, and how the Lightning multipart payments (MPP) protocol defines the amounts per part.\n\n4. New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects: The newsletter recommends upgrading to new releases or helping to test release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects. It provides a list of notable changes in projects such as Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition. The highlighted changes include new features, bug fixes, and improvements to enhance the functionality and security of these projects.\n\n5. Helping Bitcoin-based businesses integrate scaling technology: The newsletter concludes by mentioning the efforts to assist Bitcoin-based businesses in integrating scaling technology. This likely refers to initiatives aimed at enabling businesses to adopt solutions for improving scalability, such as the Lightning Network, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIn summary, the newsletter covers a proposal to prevent the pinning of coinjoin transactions, discusses mempool policy and network resource protection, highlights popular questions and answers on Bitcoin Stack Exchange, provides information about new releases and release candidates for Bitcoin infrastructure projects, and emphasizes the support for Bitcoin-based businesses in adopting scaling technology.",
      "summaryeli15": "This week's newsletter discusses several topics related to Bitcoin technology and infrastructure. Let's break down each section:\n\n1. Preventing coinjoin pinning with v3 transaction relay:\n- Coinjoin is a technique used to enhance privacy in Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple transactions into a single transaction.\n- Pinning refers to an attack where one participant in a coinjoin transaction creates a conflicting transaction that prevents the original coinjoin transaction from being confirmed.\n- Greg Sanders proposes a solution called the v3 transaction relay. This solution suggests that participants in a coinjoin transaction spend their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by either a signature from all participants or by a single participant after a set time period.\n- This ensures that conflicting transactions can only be created after a certain time period, during which the participant would need consent from other parties or the coordinator of the coinjoin.\n- The proposal assumes that certain consensus changes will be made in the future, such as adding a specific feature to the Bitcoin protocol.\n- It is important to note that this proposal has not yet received substantial discussion or feedback.\n\n2. Limited weekly series about mempool policy:\n- Mempool policy refers to the rules that determine which transactions are accepted into the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) and eventually included in a block.\n- Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive mempool policy than what is allowed by the consensus rules (the rules that all Bitcoin nodes must adhere to). This is to protect network resources and ensure a manageable blockchain size.\n- The post discusses the concept of network-wide resources and why it is important to consider them when setting mempool policies. It also emphasizes the need for a unified policy to maintain scalability, upgradeability, and accessibility of the Bitcoin network.\n\n3. Bitcoin Stack Exchange questions and answers:\n- Bitcoin Stack Exchange is a popular platform where users ask questions and receive answers from the community.\n- The newsletter highlights a few interesting questions and answers from the platform:\n    - Why do Bitcoin nodes accept blocks with excluded transactions?\n    - Why do soft forks restrict the existing ruleset?\n    - Why is the default Lightning Network channel limit set to a specific value?\n    - Why does Bitcoin Core use ancestor score in transaction selection?\n    - How does the Lightning multipart payments (MPP) protocol define the amounts per part?\n\n4. New releases and release candidates for Bitcoin infrastructure projects:\n- The newsletter provides updates on new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin software projects, including Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, BDK, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition.\n- It highlights notable changes and features introduced in these updates, such as improvements in configuration options, tracking of HTLC durations, support for anchor channels, and route finding enhancements.\n\n5. Helping Bitcoin-based businesses integrate scaling technology:\n- This section likely refers to an initiative or service aimed at assisting businesses that operate using Bitcoin to integrate and leverage scaling technologies. Unfortunately, the newsletter does not provide further details on this topic.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers various technical and policy-focused topics related to Bitcoin's privacy, transaction selection, mempool policy, and infrastructure updates. It aims to provide valuable information and insights to the Bitcoin community.",

The paper was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in the year 2023. \n\nThe paper discusses a unique phenomenon related to the use of nonces in Bitcoin's Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nonces, in this context, are random numbers generated during the signing process to enhance the security of the cryptographic algorithm.\n\nThe authors describe how they observed a peculiar pattern in the nonces used in Bitcoin transactions. They refer to it as the \"half-half\" pattern, implying that the nonce is being divided into two halves. This pattern was unexpected and raised concerns about the randomness and security of the nonces used in Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTo support their findings, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, examining numerous transactions and extracting the nonces used in each. They then perform statistical tests and analysis to identify patterns or anomalies in nonce generation.\n\nThe authors proceed to explain the potential implications of this pattern. If a malicious actor could predict the nonces used in Bitcoin transactions, they would be able to forge signatures and manipulate the system, compromising the security and integrity of the blockchain.\n\nTo conclude their research, the authors propose steps to address this issue and suggest improvements to the nonce generation process within Bitcoin's ECDSA. They advocate for the use of secure random number generators and enhanced nonce selection methods to mitigate potential attacks on the system.\n\nThe reference provides the URL to the full research paper, allowing readers to access and learn more about the specific details, methodologies, and conclusions of the study.",

The authors of the paper wanted to investigate a specific issue related to the Bitcoin ECDSA algorithm.\n\nECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographic algorithm used in Bitcoin to ensure that transactions are secure and authentic. It involves generating a pair of cryptographic keys, one private and one public, for each user. The private key is kept secret and used to sign transactions, while the public key is shared with others to verify the authenticity of signatures.\n\nOne crucial aspect of ECDSA is the generation of random numbers, called nonces. Nonces are used in the signing process to ensure that signatures cannot be easily forged. In Bitcoin, the nonces are generated by each user independently to maintain security. However, the researchers discovered an interesting pattern with the nonces used in Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe researchers found that half of the bits of the nonces used in Bitcoin transactions were fixed, meaning that they were always set to either 0 or 1. This was a curious finding because these fixed nonces made the Bitcoin system vulnerable to attacks. By exploiting this pattern, an attacker could potentially recover the private keys of other users and perform unauthorized transactions.\n\nTo understand why this vulnerability exists, it is important to note that Bitcoin transactions are broadcasted to a network of nodes, which validate and confirm the transactions. Every time a user signs a transaction, they generate a new nonce to ensure the security of the signature. However, due to various factors such as software bugs, hardware limitations, or even intentional malicious behavior, these nonces may end up having a fixed pattern.\n\nThe researchers conducted an extensive analysis of real-world Bitcoin transactions to confirm their findings. They analyzed a large number of nonces and discovered that indeed, half of the nonces had a fixed pattern. This finding raised concerns about the security of Bitcoin since an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover private keys and perform unauthorized transactions.\n\nThe paper highlights the significance of this vulnerability and its potential impact on the security and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin system. It suggests that further research and improvements are needed to address this issue and ensure the robustness of the ECDSA algorithm used in Bitcoin.\n\nIn conclusion, this research paper explores a specific vulnerability in the Bitcoin ECDSA algorithm related to the generation of nonces used in transactions. The researchers found that half of the nonces had a fixed pattern, which made the Bitcoin system vulnerable to attacks. The paper emphasizes the importance of addressing this vulnerability to enhance the overall security of Bitcoin.",

It was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in 2023. \n\nThe paper discusses the concept of block propagation in the context of cryptocurrency mining, specifically for large miners. Block propagation refers to the process of transmitting newly mined blocks to other miners in the network. In the cryptocurrency world, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain, which is essentially a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions.\n\nThe paper explores the relationship between block propagation speed and the profitability of large miners. It suggests that in certain situations, slower block propagation can be more advantageous for these miners. The term \"large miners\" refers to individuals or organizations that have a significant amount of computational power dedicated to mining.\n\nThe researchers propose a hypothesis that slower block propagation can bring benefits to large miners when they have a substantial advantage over other miners in terms of computational power. This hypothesis is based on the idea that when a large miner discovers a new block, it takes some time for the information about that block to reach other miners.\n\nDuring this time delay, the large miner can continue mining on top of the newly discovered block without any competition from other miners who have not received the block yet. This gives the large miner an opportunity to mine additional blocks, thus increasing their overall mining rewards.\n\nThe paper suggests that this advantage is more significant for large miners because they have more computational power, which means they can mine blocks at a faster rate. As a result, the time delay in block propagation allows them to extend their mining lead and accumulate more rewards.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the advantage of slower block propagation may not always be present. The researchers mention that it depends on various factors, such as the network topology, block size, and the distribution of computational power among miners.\n\nThe paper provides a theoretical analysis and simulations to support their hypothesis. They also discuss the potential implications of their findings for the cryptocurrency ecosystem and suggest further research directions.\n\nIn conclusion, this research paper explores the relationship between block propagation speed and the profitability of large miners in cryptocurrency mining. It suggests that slower block propagation can be more beneficial for large miners in certain situations, allowing them to extend their mining lead and accumulate more rewards. However, the advantage of slower block propagation is context-dependent and further research is needed to explore its implications fully.",

      "summary": "In this update, it is revealed that there has been a further loss of funds in the Atlantis Loans lending protocol on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The total funds lost now amount to $2.5 million, with former users losing approximately $1 million.\n\nThe Atlantis Loans protocol was abandoned by its developers in early April, as they stated they could no longer afford to maintain the platform. The developers claimed that discontinuing their services was in the best interest of the users and the protection of their funds. However, despite the abandonment, the protocol remained operational, with the user interface even paid up in advance for two years. The only way to make changes or shut down the platform was through governance.\n\nOn April 12th, an attempted attack on the protocol was made but failed to pass. Due to the project being abandoned, little attention was given to a proposal published on June 7th, known as proposal 52. Exploiting this lack of awareness, the attacker pushed and voted through the governance proposal, gaining control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts. They then upgraded the contracts with their own malicious code, enabling them to transfer tokens from any address that still had active approvals to Atlantis contracts.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of how the proposal was executed, one can refer to Numen Cyber's thread on the matter. The attacker's address is provided as 0xEADe071FF23bceF312deC938eCE29f7da62CF45b. It is also noted that the initial funding for the attacker came from Binance on the Ethereum network.\n\nGovernance attacks can come in different forms and can have varying effects. This incident serves as a reminder to revoke old token approvals and emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring governance processes, even on projects that are no longer active or maintained.\n\nIn addition to the Atlantis Loans case, other recent incidents are mentioned. Tornado Cash experienced a governance system hijack, Beanstalk suffered a flash loan-enabled governance attack, and Swerve faced an unsuccessful attempt at a governance attack. These cases highlight the need for vigilance and caution in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nThe author concludes by explaining that REKT is a public platform for anonymous authors, and they take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT. They also provide a donation address for those interested in supporting them.\n\nThe update then briefly mentions two other incidents. DeFiLabs, a project on the BSC, rug pulled $1.6 million from its users through a backdoor function in their staking contract. Midas, another project, lost $600,000 due to a known vulnerability. Lastly, Level Finance had $1.1 million in referral rewards stolen, with the attack going unnoticed for over a week. The author wonders if a warning could have prevented the attack on Level Finance.",

      "summaryeli15": "Sure! Let's break down the information in detail.\n\n1. ALPHV Ransomware Adds Data Leak API in New Extortion Strategy:\nRansomware is a type of malicious software that hackers use to encrypt files on a victim's computer or network. The victim is then asked to pay a ransom in order to regain access to their files. ALPHV is a specific type of ransomware that has recently been updated with a new feature called a data leak API. This means that in addition to encrypting files, the ransomware can also steal sensitive data from the victim's computer. The hackers can then use this stolen data as leverage to further extort the victim into paying the ransom.\n\n2. Ivanti Patches New Zero-Day Exploited in Norwegian Govt Attacks:\nZero-day refers to a vulnerability in software that is unknown to the software developer and therefore has no patch or fix available. In this case, the software vulnerability was exploited (or taken advantage of) in attacks targeting the Norwegian government. Ivanti is a company that develops patches or updates for software to fix vulnerabilities. They have released a patch to address this particular zero-day exploit and protect users from being attacked.\n\n3. Zimbra Patches Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploited in XSS Attacks:\nAnother zero-day vulnerability was found, this time in Zimbra, a popular email and collaboration platform. This vulnerability was being exploited in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks involve injecting malicious code into a website or web application, which then executes that code in the user's browser. Zimbra has released a patch to fix this vulnerability and prevent further XSS attacks.\n\n4. New Android Malware Uses OCR to Steal Credentials from Images:\nAndroid malware refers to malicious software that targets Android devices. In this case, a new type of malware has been discovered that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to steal credentials from images. OCR is a technology that converts images of text into machine-readable text. The malware is able to extract usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information from images on the infected device.\n\n5. Linux Version of Abyss Locker Ransomware Targets VMware ESXi Servers:\nAbyss Locker is a type of ransomware that targets Linux systems. Specifically, this variant of the ransomware is designed to attack VMware ESXi servers, which are virtualization platforms used in enterprise environments. Once the ransomware infects these servers, it will encrypt the files and demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.\n\n6. Browser Developers Push Back on Google's \"Web DRM\" WEI API:\nWeb DRM refers to digital rights management technology that is used to protect copyrighted content on the web. Google has developed an API (Application Programming Interface) called Web Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) to support this DRM technology.

      "summary": "The researchers came up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs because they discovered that the intensity/color of these LEDs can provide information about the beginning and end of cryptographic operations. They realized that the brightness/intensity of a device's power LED is directly related to its power consumption, which in turn can be affected by the CPU operations. They found that the power LED is connected directly to the power line of the electrical circuit, without any effective means of decoupling the correlation between its brightness and power consumption. This means that by analyzing the intensity/color variations of the power LED, they can potentially extract sensitive information about the cryptographic operations being performed.\n\nThe researchers explain that their approach to video-based cryptanalysis is different from prior methods. They demonstrate that by combining vulnerable cryptographic algorithms (ones that are susceptible to side-channel attacks) with vulnerable power LEDs (that leak information through their color/brightness), attackers can exploit these weaknesses to recover secret keys. They argue that their method presents a weaker threat model compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods used for cryptanalysis. This is because video-based cryptanalysis allows attackers to recover secret keys using commonly available sensors like video cameras, rather than requiring specialized and expensive equipment like scopes or electromagnetic radiation sensors. Additionally, their method does not require compromising the target device with malware.\n\nAlthough the origin of the vulnerabilities lies in the cryptographic libraries and not specifically in the power LEDs, the researchers highlight that power LEDs provide the necessary infrastructure to exploit these vulnerabilities visually. This is because the color and intensity of the power LED can be used as a means to gather information about the cryptographic operations being performed.\n\nTo prevent the demonstrated attacks, the researchers recommend using the most updated cryptographic libraries available. By using the latest versions of these libraries, the chances of exploiting vulnerabilities that have already been patched are reduced.\n\nThe researchers chose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks because they were recently discovered and serve as reminders that even supposedly up-to-date cryptographic libraries can have vulnerabilities. By highlighting these attacks, they emphasize the need for continual vigilance and the importance of regularly updating cryptographic libraries to address any newly discovered weaknesses.\n\nDespite using the most updated cryptographic libraries, there is still a possibility of being at risk as there may be undiscovered vulnerabilities (referred to as 0-day vulnerabilities) in the code. The researchers note that in the past, the currently known vulnerable cryptographic libraries were considered the most updated ones before their vulnerabilities were discovered. Therefore, it is essential to stay vigilant and monitor for any new security updates and patches.\n\nThe researchers found that at least six smartcard readers from five different manufacturers that are sold on Amazon are vulnerable to a direct attack using their video-based cryptanalysis method. Additionally, they discovered that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is vulnerable to an indirect attack through video footage obtained from the power LED of connected peripheral devices.\n\nAttackers need to obtain video footage filled with the LED of the target device because cryptanalysis requires a high sampling rate. By capturing the LED in the video frame and exploiting the rolling shutter feature of the camera, attackers can significantly increase the number of measurements of the LED's color/intensity. This increase goes from the typical frame rate per second (FPS), which is around 60 measurements per second, to the rolling shutter's speed, which can be up to 60,000 measurements per second in devices like the iPhone 13 Pro Max. This higher sampling rate enables attackers to gather the necessary data to launch their attacks effectively on various IoT devices, including smartphones, smartcards, TV streamers, and more.\n\nIf a device does not have a power LED, it eliminates the direct risk of attackers recovering secret keys from the LED itself. However, it is still possible for attackers to recover the secret key indirectly by analyzing video footage obtained from the power LED of a connected peripheral device. So while the lack of a power LED reduces the risk, it does not completely eliminate it.\n\nOverall, the researchers came up with the idea of using power LEDs for cryptanalysis because they discovered that the intensity/color variations of these LEDs can provide valuable information about the cryptographic operations being performed. By combining vulnerable algorithms with vulnerable power LEDs, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to recover secret keys. This video-based cryptanalysis technique presents a weaker threat model compared to traditional methods and can be carried out using readily available video cameras without compromising the target device with malware. However, staying up to date with the latest cryptographic libraries and ensuring good security practices can help mitigate the risks associated with these types of attacks.",
      "summaryeli15": "A: The idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs came from understanding the correlation between the intensity/color of the power LED and the device's power consumption. In many electrical circuits, the power LED is directly connected to the power line without any effective means of decoupling the correlation. This means that the brightness/intensity of the power LED can actually reveal information about the device's CPU operations, including cryptographic operations.\n\nBy detecting the beginning and end of cryptographic operations based on the changes in the power LED's intensity/color, it is possible to exploit this vulnerability and recover secret keys. The power LED serves as a visual indicator of the device's power consumption, providing a way for attackers to analyze and extract sensitive information.\n\nThe vulnerability, however, does not originate from the power LED itself, but rather from the cryptographic libraries used in the devices. The power LEDs simply provide the infrastructure needed to visually exploit the vulnerability.\n\nTo prevent these types of attacks, it is important to use the most updated cryptographic libraries available. However, even with up-to-date libraries, there is still a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities or zero-day vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This highlights the need for constant vigilance and research to ensure the security of cryptographic systems.\n\nThe researchers chose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks because these were recent discoveries. By showcasing these attacks, they wanted to emphasize that even the most updated cryptographic libraries can have vulnerabilities. It serves as a reminder that security is an ongoing challenge and that new threats can always emerge.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable devices, the researchers found that at least six smartcard readers from five different manufacturers sold on Amazon were vulnerable to direct attacks using video-based cryptanalysis. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S8 was vulnerable to an indirect attack. These examples demonstrate that a range of devices can be susceptible to this type of cryptanalysis.\n\nIn order to conduct cryptanalysis using video footage, attackers need to obtain high-quality video footage containing the power LED of the target device. The reason for this is that cryptanalysis requires a high sampling rate to accurately analyze the changes in the power LED's intensity/color. By filling the frame with the LED, attackers can exploit the rolling shutter effect of video cameras to increase the number of measurements by three orders of magnitude. This allows for a much higher sampling rate, enabling the attack on devices such as smartphones, smartcards, and TV streamers.\n\nEven if a device does not have a power LED, it may still be at risk indirectly. Attackers can potentially recover secret keys by analyzing video footage obtained from a power LED of a connected peripheral device.\n\nOverall, the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs stemmed from understanding the correlation between the power LED's intensity/color and the device's power consumption. By exploiting this correlation and using video footage, attackers can recover secret keys from vulnerable devices.",

      "summary": "Sturdy Finance, an Ethereum-based lending protocol, has experienced a loss of approximately $800k due to a price manipulation exploit. The protocol allows yield farmers to deposit staked assets as collateral in order to leverage their yields.\n\nAfter the exploit was discovered, the Sturdy Finance team confirmed the attack and took immediate action. They paused all markets to prevent any additional funds from being at risk, and assured users that no further action was required on their part.\n\nThe attack on Sturdy Finance utilized a flash loan, a type of loan that is borrowed and repaid within the same transaction, to target the SturdyOracle. The attacker manipulated the price of the collateral token, B-stETH-STABLE, and successfully made a profit of 442 ETH, equivalent to $800k. The stolen funds were then quickly deposited into Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that allows for the anonymous transfer of tokens.\n\nThis type of attack, known as a read-only reentrancy vulnerability, has been observed in several attacks over the past year. It was previously seen in similar exploits on Midas Capital and dForce Network.\n\nInterestingly, there were three audits conducted on Sturdy Finance by reputable firms Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena, which makes it surprising that the vulnerability was not detected and addressed during the auditing process. This has led to discussions about the need for oracle-free lending systems, as the reliance on oracles can introduce vulnerabilities.\n\nIn a separate incident, DeFiLabs, a project on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), lost $1.6M due to a backdoor function in their staking contract. This kind of exploit is not uncommon on BSC and has led to a negative reputation for certain projects on the network.\n\nAnother project, AlphaPo, recently lost $60M, but as compromised hot wallets have become somewhat commonplace, the incident did not receive much attention. The final example is EraLend, which lost $3.4M to the same read-only reentrancy bug that has affected many protocols within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nOverall, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities present in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It reinforces the need for thorough audits and security measures to protect user funds.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! So, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Sturdy Finance is a lending protocol that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to deposit their assets as collateral and then borrow funds to generate additional yield.\n\n2. Unfortunately, Sturdy Finance recently experienced a price manipulation exploit that resulted in a loss of around $800,000. This means that someone was able to manipulate the prices of certain assets within the protocol and profit from it.\n\n3. The Sturdy Finance team quickly became aware of the attack and took action. They paused all markets to prevent further funds from being at risk, and they assured users that no additional actions were required at that time.\n\n4. It's important to note that this type of attack is not unique to Sturdy Finance. Other similar attacks have occurred on platforms like Midas Capital and dForce Network, so it seems like there is a common vulnerability being exploited.\n\n5. In this particular attack, the hacker used something called a flash loan to target the SturdyOracle, which is a component of the protocol. They manipulated the price of a specific token called B-stETH-STABLE, potentially to their advantage.\n\n6. The attacker's address (0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b) and the attack contract (0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab) are provided for reference, in case anyone wants to investigate further.\n\n7. The hacker was able to make a profit of 442 ETH, which is equivalent to about $800,000. They then deposited this money into a service called Tornado Cash, which is often used for anonymizing and laundering funds. The whole process took only 20 minutes.\n\n8. This type of vulnerability, known as a read-only reentrancy bug, has been seen in multiple attacks over the past year. It seems that some protocols, including Sturdy Finance, are vulnerable to this type of exploit.\n\n9. Despite having undergone three audits from reputable firms (Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena), the fact that these vulnerabilities still exist is surprising. It raises concerns about the security of the auditing process and highlights the need for better security measures.\n\n10. The incident also sparks a discussion about the necessity of oracle-free lending systems, which would not rely on external sources of information. However, it is acknowledged that certain solutions may still require some form of oracle.\n\n11. The hope for the future is that protocols like Sturdy Finance will learn from this situation and build stronger foundations to prevent such exploits from happening again.\n\n12. It's important to note that, as a platform for anonymous authors, REKT (the source of this information) does not take responsibility for the views or content hosted on its platform.\n\n13. Additionally, there are mentions of other incidents in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, such as DeFiLabs losing $1.6 million and AlphaPo losing $60 million. These incidents highlight the ongoing risks and vulnerabilities in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n14. The reference to Lazarus not getting bored implies that hackers and attackers are continuously searching for new opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n15. Finally, EraLend is another project that fell victim to a read-only reentrancy bug, resulting in a loss of $3.4 million. The comment about comments not being effective reentrancy protection suggests that their protocols may not have been adequately protected against this type of vulnerability.\n\nOverall, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenges and risks associated with the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance and the need for stronger security measures within the industry.",

It also adds functionality to retrieve a cursor that will provide records beginning with a specified prefix.\n\nOne aspect mentioned is that iterating through the entire database allows the wallet to find unknown records. However, currently, the wallet does not do anything with these unknown records except output a number in a log line. With this pull request, the wallet would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This change does not affect functionality since the wallet does not do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not considered an error.

      "summary": "This passage is describing a pull request in a software development project, specifically related to the networking functionality of the software. The pull request suggests changes to prioritize nodes provided through a \"seednode\" mechanism over fixed seeds.\n\nIn the software, when the user specifies a seednode, the system makes a connection to that specific peer and gathers addresses from them. This helps bootstrap the network by getting addresses of other peers. The intention is that if the user specifies a seednode, they prefer addresses from that node over the fixed seeds.\n\nHowever, there was a race condition when disabling DNS seeds and specifying a seednode. In this scenario, the system would immediately remove the seednode address from the list before it could provide addresses. As a result, the system would fall back to using fixed seeds, leading to a race between the fixed seeds and the seednodes in populating the address manager.\n\nTo address this issue, the pull request suggests a change in logic. Instead of relying on the size of the address fetch list (`m_addr_fetches`), the system should check if any seednode addresses are provided. If there is at least one seednode address specified, the system should delay querying the fixed seeds for 1 minute. This delay gives the seednodes an opportunity to provide the system with addresses before falling back to the fixed seeds.\n\nThe pull request also mentions the possibility of not querying DNS seeds if the user specifies a seednode, to avoid doing both at the same time. This could be a separate pull request.\n\nOverall, the suggested changes in the pull request aim to improve the prioritization of seednodes over fixed seeds and address a race condition in the system's network bootstrapping process.",
      "summaryeli15": "This passage is discussing a proposal to change the way Bitcoin Core handles bootstrap mechanisms, specifically the `-seednode` option. Currently, when a user specifies a seednode, Bitcoin Core establishes a connection with that node, gathers addresses from it, and then disconnects. The idea is that if users specify a seednode, they prefer addresses from that node over the fixed seeds.\n\nHowever, there is an issue when disabling DNS seeds and specifying `-seednode`. The code immediately removes the entry from the `m_addr_fetches` list (which holds the addresses fetched from seednodes) before the seednode has a chance to provide addresses. As a result, when the `m_addr_fetches` list becomes empty, the code adds fixed seeds, leading to a race between the fixed seeds and seednodes for filling up the address manager.\n\nTo address this issue, the proposed change suggests checking for any provided `-seednode` argument instead of using the size of the `m_addr_fetches` list. This change would delay the querying of fixed seeds for 1 minute when any seednode is specified, giving the seednodes a chance to provide addresses before falling back to fixed seeds.\n\nThe suggested change can be tested by running `bitcoind -debug=net -dnsseed=0 -seednode=(...)` on a node without a `peers.dat` file and observing the debug log.\n\nThe passage also mentions that there are conflicting pull requests and requests reviewers to prioritize reviewing the conflicting ones.\n\nAdditionally, there are some suggestions for simplifications and optimizations related to the proposed change, which are mentioned in comments throughout the passage.\n\nOverall, the passage explains the current issue with seednodes and fixed seeds, and proposes a solution to prioritize seednodes over fixed seeds when specifying `-seednode`.

      "summary": "This is a code review discussion about a specific feature or functionality related to relaying transactions in a blockchain network. The main topic of discussion is the removal of a data structure called \"mapRelay\" and its replacement with a new data structure called \"m_most_recent_block_txs\".\n\nInitially, the discussion mentions that there are issues with mapRelay, which is used to relay announced transactions that are no longer in the mempool. The reasons for these transactions being removed from the mempool are not explicitly mentioned in this snippet but are stated to be discussed further elsewhere. It is also stated that the rationale for not relaying these transactions is considered acceptable.\n\nThe next part of the discussion mentions the possibility of moving mapRelay into a data structure called \"txmempool\" so that its size can be counted as part of a specified limit (300MB or similar). It is suggested that this could provide better control over the memory usage by allowing for trimming of mapRelay before the scheduled expiry time. The idea is to have an index that maps transactions to their identifiers (txid, wtxid), along with a counter to track how many entries in mapRelay are not in the mempool.\n\nThere is some concern raised about the potential trade-off between compact block relay performance and memory usage when trimming mapRelay. It is mentioned that trimming could either degrade compact block relay when the mempool is full or lead to lost fee income by trimming valid mempool transactions. It is suggested that using separate and dedicated size limits for mapRelay and the mempool might make it easier to manage their memory usage separately.\n\nThe discussion then moves on to discussing the benefit of having mapRelay overlap with the mempool. It is questioned why mapRelay is needed if its main purpose is to handle transactions that could be in blocks. It is suggested that if mapRelay is moved into txmempool, the transactions could be added to mapRelay whenever something is evicted from the mempool for a block-related reason and the timestamp is recent. It is proposed to cap mapRelay at a few thousand entries in this case.\n\nThe suggestion to trim mapRelay before the scheduled expiry time is brought up again, but the concerns about memory usage and compact block relay performance are reiterated. It is mentioned that the advantage of linking mapRelay and the mempool together for limits is that trimming the mempool due to mapRelay size would increase the mempool minfee and reduce Replace-By-Fee (RBF) headroom. This refers to the ability to increase the fee of a transaction after it has been broadcasted.\n\nThe discussion continues with questions about the benefit of keeping mapRelay overlapping with the mempool and the rationale behind the chosen expiry duration (15 minutes). It is suggested that the expiry duration could be shorter and there is no strong reason for it to be 15 minutes. It is also mentioned that the purpose of mapRelay has changed over time, from being the only way to find a transaction to being a way to get at transactions that are new to the mempool.\n\nThe discussion then moves on to considering alternatives to mapRelay. It is proposed that instead of using mapRelay, the last block received (stored in memory as m_most_recent_block) could be indexed to provide the necessary information for relaying transactions that were just removed in a block. It is suggested that by building an index into the last block, mapRelay can be eliminated.\n\nThere is some back-and-forth discussion about whether REPLACED transactions should be relayed and the privacy implications of relaying them. It is mentioned that there may be potential privacy issues if replaced transactions are relayed, as it could reveal network topology information. There is agreement that the decision to relay replaced transactions should not be a prerequisite for dropping mapRelay.\n\nThe discussion then references another pull request (#17303) and suggests reviewing the comments there. It is stated that most of the issues raised in that pull request have already been addressed. There is agreement that serving transactions from the most recent block before dropping mapRelay should be ensured.\n\nThe discussion then touches upon the idea of serving transactions from a separate data structure called \"vExtraTxnForCompact\" and its potential use for resolving orphans. It is suggested that serving transactions from vExtraTxnForCompact could help address the privacy issue related to RBF relay. It is stated that addressing this issue does not need to be a prerequisite for dropping mapRelay.\n\nOne participant suggests a straightforward approach for continuing to serve transactions from the mempool that have been recently removed. It involves keeping track of the last ~700 removed transactions in the mempool, along with their entry time and removal time. These transactions can then be relayed to peers based on the entry and removal times. The likelihood of not sending an inv to inbounds in the given time period is estimated to be around once every 12 days.\n\nThere is a discussion about the privacy implications of serving transactions from vExtraTxnForCompact and potential solutions to mitigate those implications. It is pointed out that if a spy node sends a transaction and its replacement immediately after, it could create a unique fingerprint that can be used to identify network reachability. It is acknowledged that there are privacy concerns but also mentioned that there are other ways to infer network topology using transaction relay behavior.\n\nThe discussion concludes with a suggestion to move forward with a pull request that uses the recently announced filter to determine when to relay from the mempool or the most recent block. It is mentioned that the pull request to remove the recently announced filter can be updated to support the changes discussed.",

      "summary": "This PR (Pull Request) is making changes to the code to solve an issue (#836) in the project. Specifically, it adds a P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot) descriptor template and a BIP86 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 86) taproot descriptor template. These templates allow users to create a taproot descriptor more easily.\n\nThe reason for this change is to address a confusion that arose when a Mainnet descriptor was found to match with a Regtest (regression testing) address. The reason for this is that the first network is used for setting the 2nd derivation index of Bipxx (a specific Bitcoin Improvement Proposal), while the second network is used for the address prefix.\n\nAs a result, if someone uses the same extended private key (Xpriv) but builds the project with `build(Network::Regtest)` and derives addresses, they will not match up with the expected test vector.\n\nTo resolve this confusion, the author of the PR suggests two options. The first option is to change the first network to Regtest in the build call, while the second option is to change the second network to Mainnet. The author suggests that the first option is simpler and can be implemented in a separate PR.\n\nIn response, another contributor agrees with the first option and plans to create a small PR to address it. They also mention that they will open an issue to keep track of the changes.\n\nThere are some additional comments and discussions about rebasing the PR, merging it with other branches, and its compatibility with other features and projects.

This PR adds two descriptor templates that users can use as a starting point for creating their taproot descriptors.\n\nHowever, there was some confusion about the network settings used in the templates. The \"Mainnet\" descriptor template was matching with a \"Regtest\" (Regression Test) address. The reason for this is that the first network is used to set the derivation index for a specific Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP), and the second network is used as a prefix for the address.\n\nTo address this confusion, there are two potential solutions.

The second option is to change the second network to \"Mainnet\".\n\nAfter discussing with another contributor, the decision was made to go with the first option. A small PR will be created to implement this change.

      "summaryeli15": "This pull request aims to add a new feature to the codebase. Specifically, it wants to expose signature verification functionality for ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures on the `PublicKey` type. \n\nECDSA is a widely used cryptographic algorithm that provides a way to digitally sign data and verify the integrity of the signature. In this case, the `PublicKey` type refers to a piece of data that represents a public key, which can be used to verify the authenticity of a digital signature.\n\nThe proposed change would allow developers to verify ECDSA signatures using the `PublicKey` type in the codebase. This can be useful in applications that require verifying signatures for security purposes, such as authenticating users or validating the integrity of data.\n\nHowever, the pull request also mentions that an identical function needs to be added to the `XOnlyPublicKey` type. `XOnlyPublicKey` is a specific type of public key used in the SECP256k1 cryptographic library, which is often used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This additional functionality for `XOnlyPublicKey` would need to be implemented in the `secp2561` library, referenced in the pull request as `rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1#618`.\n\nThe reasoning behind this change is not explicitly stated in the pull request, but it could be inferred that the ability to verify ECDSA signatures on the `PublicKey` and `XOnlyPublicKey` types would enhance the overall functionality and security of the codebase.\n\nIf this pull request is successfully merged into the codebase, it may resolve any related issues or feature requests and close them.",

      "summaryeli15": "This is a detailed explanation of the information provided:\n\nThe text is referring to a library written in the C programming language that is optimized for performing operations on the secp256k1 curve. The library is specifically designed for cryptographic operations, such as ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations. It is intended to be of the highest quality and is widely used in the Bitcoin system.\n\nTo work with this library, you can use the official command-line interface (CLI) provided. The CLI allows you to perform various tasks using the library's functionalities. You can learn more about the CLI by referring to the documentation.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the execution of commands or while using the library, you can try downloading GitHub Desktop, a graphical user interface application for managing GitHub repositories, and retry the operation.\n\nThe library also supports optional modules, such as Schnorr signatures. To enable these modules, you need to run specific commands during the compilation process. For example, you can use the \"./configure\" command with additional flags to enable the Schnorr signature module. You can refer to the documentation or use the \"--help\" flag to see the full list of available options.\n\nTo maintain a clean and organized source tree, the library encourages performing a build process called an \"out-of-source build.\" This means that the build process should be done in a separate dedicated build tree, rather than in the same directory as the source code. This approach is recommended when using CMake, a build system tool used for managing the build process.\n\nIf you want to cross-compile the library for different platforms, such as Windows or Android, the library provides preconfigured toolchain files to simplify the process. For example, to cross-compile for Windows, you can follow the provided example. Similarly, for Android, assuming you have set the ANDROID_NDK_ROOT environment variable, you can use the provided toolchain file.\n\nIf you want to build the library on Windows using Visual Studio, you need to specify the appropriate generator for a new build tree. The example assumes the usage of Visual Studio 2022 and CMake version 3.21 or higher.\n\nThe library includes usage examples in the examples directory. To compile and execute these examples, you need to configure the library with the \"--enable-examples\" flag.\n\nIf you want to create a test coverage report to assess the code coverage of the library, you can configure the library with the \"--enable-coverage\" flag. This requires the use of GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). To generate the report, it is recommended to use a tool called gcovr, as it includes branch coverage reporting. The report can be obtained in various formats, including HTML with colored and annotated source code.\n\nBy default, if the library is configured with the \"--enable-benchmark\" flag, you will find binary files in the root directory after the build that allow you to perform benchmarks on the libsecp256k1 functions.\n\nFinally, the text includes some specific commands in a Unix-like shell format. These commands demonstrate how to execute certain actions related to the library, such as running tests, installing the library, or creating CSV files from benchmark results. The explanations below each command give a brief overview of their purpose.",

      "summary": "Core Lightning is a software implementation of the Lightning Network protocol that focuses on being lightweight, customizable, and compliant with the network's specifications. It has been used on the Bitcoin mainnet since 2018 and is considered stable for use.\n\nTo get started with Core Lightning, it is recommended to experiment on a testnet or regtest environment. However, you can also use it on the Bitcoin mainnet with confidence. The development team welcomes any help in testing the implementation, reporting bugs, or assisting with outstanding issues. You can reach out to them through various channels such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, or Telegram.\n\nCore Lightning is compatible with Linux and macOS operating systems and requires a locally or remotely running bitcoind (Bitcoin core software) version 0.16 or above that is fully synchronized with the network. It also requires the ability to relay transactions. Partial support for pruning (reducing the amount of data stored by the node) is available, and more details can be found in the provided link.\n\nTo experiment with lightningd (the Lightning Network daemon), there is a script available to set up a test network of two local lightning nodes using bitcoind in regtest mode. This script provides a convenient helper tool called start_ln. Instructions on how to use it can be found in the comments at the top of the startup_regtest.sh file.\n\nIt's important to note that configuring your node to expose developer options will make it faster and more responsive.\n\nTo test with real bitcoin, you need to have a local bitcoind node running and synchronized with the network. Make sure the walletbroadcast setting in the bitcoin.conf file is not set to 0, as it may cause issues. Running lightningd against a pruned node requires careful management.\n\nOnce you have set up Core Lightning, you can use the lightning-cli tool to interact with it. It provides a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. You can use lightning-cli help to see a table of available RPC methods and get specific information about each command using lightning-cli help [command].\n\nA script called bootstrap-node.sh is available to connect your node to other nodes on the Lightning network and start interacting with them.\n\nCore Lightning also supports various plugins that add additional capabilities to the implementation. A collection of plugins can be found on GitHub. One notable plugin is helpme, which guides users through setting up channels and customizing their node.\n\nFor a more secure experience, you can encrypt the HD wallet seed using the provided encryption functionality.\n\nIf you need assistance or have questions, you can join the community chat on libera.chat or reach out to other users in the #c-lightning channel.\n\nTo start using the Lightning Network, you need to transfer funds to your lightningd node to open a channel. The funds will be registered once the transaction is confirmed. If the faucet you're using does not support the bech32 address format, you may need to generate a p2sh-segwit address instead.\n\nTo connect to a remote node and open a channel, use the lightning-cli connect [node_ID] and lightning-cli fundchannel [amount] commands. The funding transaction requires multiple confirmations before the channel becomes usable and is announced to the network. You can check the status of the channel using the lightning-cli listpeers command and verify its public status using lightning-cli listchannels.\n\nIn Lightning, payments are made based on invoices. The recipient generates an invoice with the expected amount in millisatoshi and a unique identifier. The payer can use the invoice's bolt11 string to decode and pay it using the lightning-cli decodepay and lightning-cli pay commands, respectively. More advanced interfaces and options are available for sophisticated use cases.\n\nConfiguration of lightningd can be done through command-line options or a configuration file. Command-line options always override values in the configuration file. To use a configuration file, create a file named config within your lightning directory. A sample configuration file is available for reference.\n\nTo encrypt the hsm_secret content, which is used to derive the HD wallet's master key, you can pass the --encrypted-hsm startup argument or use the hsmtool provided in the repository's tool/ directory to encrypt and decrypt the hsm_secret.\n\nDevelopers interested in contributing to Core Lightning can refer to the developer guide. Enabling developer options during configuration provides additional checks and options for development purposes.",

Make sure your bitcoin.conf file does not have walletbroadcast=0, as it may cause issues. Once bitcoind is ready, you can start lightningd, the Core Lightning daemon, using the provided command.\n\nAfter starting lightningd, a .lightning/ subdirectory will be created in your home directory, which contains configuration files and other runtime options. You can refer to the man page (man -l doc/lightningd.8) or the online documentation (https://docs.corelightning.org/docs) for more information on available options.\n\nCore Lightning provides a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket.

You can check the channel's status using the lightning-cli listpeers command.\n\nPayments in the Lightning Network are invoice-based. The recipient creates an invoice specifying the expected amount, and the payer uses the lightning-cli pay command to pay the invoice. The invoice is represented by a bolt11 string, named after the BOLT #11 lightning specification. The payer can decode the invoice using the lightning-cli decodepay command to view its details before making the payment.\n\nConfiguration options for lightningd can be passed via the command line or through a configuration file. Command line options always override the values in the configuration file. To use a configuration file, create a file named config within your top-level lightning directory or network subdirectory. Detailed information on the configuration file structure can be found in the man page (man -l doc/lightningd-config.5).\n\nFor developers interested in contributing to Core Lightning, there is a developer guide available.

Contacting the maintainers: Users are encouraged to sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers of the project if they have any questions or concerns.\n\n4. Persisting feature bits on channel creation: The passage mentions that when a channel is created with a peer, the feature bits of that peer can be persistently stored and loaded upon restart. This allows for more consistent behavior after a restart, before reconnecting with the peer. The example given is determining whether a peer has opted in to anysegwit when creating taproot outputs.\n\n5. Limited persistence: The persistence of feature bits only applies to new channel creations and is not persistent for each connection.\n\n6. Potential fix for test issues: Anecdotally, the project addressed some test issues locally, and if others agree, the changes can be incorporated into the corresponding pull request (#6035) after rebasing.\n\n7. Aim for minimal changes: The PR (Pull Request) mentioned in point 6 aimed for minimal changes, possibly sacrificing maximal cleanliness. The comment suggests that additional rewriting may be desirable for cleaner code.\n\n8. Open-coded function: The comment suggests that a specific function is only called once and would be clearer if its code were directly written where it is used, instead of being encapsulated in a function.\n\n9. Changelog inclusion: The author wonders whether the changes made deserve to be mentioned in the project's changelog. This indicates that the changes may be significant enough to be noteworthy.\n\n10. Request for proper CI testing: The author expresses the desire to see a proper run of the project in CI (Continuous Integration) using a PostgreSQL database. This request stems from the fact that a previous CI run caught a logic issue before.\n\n11. Trivial fixes to reduce RTT: The author takes the responsibility to make small fixes themselves in order to reduce the Round Trip Time (RTT). This indicates their willingness to make quick adjustments to address issues.\n\n12. Accidental addition in destroy_peer function: The passage mentions that an accidental addition of \"tal_free(peer->their_features)\" was made to the destroy_peer function.

      "summary": "Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis text discusses the changes made to the core lightning software with regards to handling the blockchain information. The author mentions that when the core lightning software requests information about the blockchain using the \"getchaininfo\" command, it already knows the minimum and maximum block heights. However, a problem arises when using a smarter Bitcoin backend that is capable of switching between different clients. In such cases, it is helpful for the core lightning software to provide the current known height to the plugin.\n\nThe author states that this information is particularly useful when syncing a new backend from scratch, such as the \"nakamoto\" backend. By providing the correct known height from lightningd to the plugin, the plugin can attempt to fix any problems that may arise during the syncing process. This helps avoid returning a lower height than the known height, which could potentially crash the core lightning software.\n\nAdditionally, by passing down the correct known height to the plugin, the plugin can start syncing the blockchain and only return an answer when it is fully synchronized with the current status of lightningd. This ensures that the plugin is aware of the correct blockchain height and can handle requests accordingly.\n\nThe author mentions that the reason for adding this new field in the plugin and not waiting for the correct block in core lightning itself is because Bitcoin Core, the underlying backend, is slow to sync up. Therefore, waiting for the correct block height in core lightning could lead to longer waiting times. By informing the plugin about the height, it can start syncing and the execution can be moved to another backend if needed until the previous one is ready.\n\nThe author concludes by stating that the goal is to prevent being left in the dark when using the \"getchaininfo\" command and to provide the opportunity to wait for blockchain synchronization or dispatch the request elsewhere if necessary. The author is open to working on a solution inside core lightning if it is deemed more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the changes made to the core lightning software involve passing the current known block height down to the \"getchaininfo\" call in order to improve syncing with a new backend and avoid crashes or incorrect height reporting. This change allows the plugin to sync the chain and only provide an answer when fully synchronized with the lightningd.",

It strongly recommends that users thoroughly read the official Eclair documentation before running their own node.\n\n19. Configuration Files and Default Paths: Eclair reads its configuration file and writes its logs to the default directory \"~/.eclair.\" To change the node's configuration, users need to create a file named \"eclair.conf\" in the \"~/.eclair\" directory. An example configuration file is provided.\n\n20. Eclair's Funding and Wallet: Eclair uses the default loaded Bitcoin Core wallet to fund any channels the user chooses to open. If the user wants to use a different wallet, they must set the \"eclair.bitcoind.wallet\" parameter accordingly in the \"eclair.conf\" file. Changing the wallet while having open channels may result in a loss of funds or require a complex recovery procedure.\n\n21. Tweaking Bitcoin Core Parameters: The documentation suggests tweaking certain Bitcoin Core parameters in the \"bitcoin.conf\" file. These tweaks allow unblocking long chains of unconfirmed channel funding transactions using the Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) method.\n\n22. Java Environment Variables: Eclair provides some advanced parameters that can be changed using Java environment variables. Most users won't need this unless they encounter Java heap size errors. An example is given to increase the maximum memory allocated to the JVM.\n\n23. Separate Data Directory for Multiple Instances: If a user wants to run multiple instances of Eclair on the same machine, using a separate data directory is mandatory. Ports in the \"eclair.conf\" file also need to be changed accordingly.\n\n24. Logback Configuration: Eclair uses logback for logging. Users can use a different configuration and override the default \"logback.xml\" by executing a specific command.\n\n25. Backup Requirements for Bitcoin Core: Users are advised to backup the wallet file for the Bitcoin Core wallet that Eclair is using. The documentation refers to the Bitcoin Core documentation for more information on managing wallets.\n\n26. Backup Requirements for Eclair: Users need to backup specific files located in their data directory to ensure the safety of their Eclair node. Backing up the snapshot of the database (eclair.sqlite.bak) is important in addition to following recommended backup practices.\n\n27. Backup Notification Script: Users can configure a backup notification script to be called by Eclair when a new database snapshot is created. An example option is provided.\n\n28. Docker: Users who prefer running Eclair in a Docker container can find instructions on how to build and run the container. Separate instructions are provided for different platforms (x86_64 and arm64).\n\n29. Eclair Plugins: Eclair supports the use of plugins written in Scala, Java, or any JVM-compatible language. Plugins need to follow specific requirements to be considered valid and functional. More details can be found in the eclair-plugins repository.\n\n30. Running Eclair on Testnet, Regtest, or Signet: By default, Eclair is configured to run on the mainnet. However, users can also run it on testnet, regtest, or signet. Instructions for modifying Eclair's chain parameter and Bitcoin RPC port are provided.\n\n31. Network-Specific Configuration: The documentation suggests taking advantage of new configuration sections in the \"bitcoin.conf\" file to manage network-specific parameters easily. It provides an example with specific parameters for different networks.\n\nThe information provided covers various aspects of setting up, configuring, and running Eclair, as well as precautions and best practices to ensure a smooth and secure experience.",
      "summaryeli15": "Eclair is a software program written in Scala that implements the Lightning Network, which is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables faster and cheaper transactions by allowing users to create payment channels that can be used to transact with each other off-chain. Eclair follows the Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs), which are a set of rules and guidelines for Lightning Network implementations.\n\nEclair provides a feature-rich HTTP API that allows application developers to easily integrate with the Lightning Network. This API enables developers to perform various actions such as opening and closing payment channels, sending and receiving payments, and interacting with other Lightning Network nodes.\n\nIt's important to note that Eclair's JSON API should not be accessible from the outside world, similar to the Bitcoin Core API. This is for security reasons, as exposing the API can potentially make your funds vulnerable to attacks. To configure your Eclair node and learn how to connect to other nodes, open channels, send and receive payments, and handle more advanced scenarios, you can refer to the documentation in the \"docs\" folder.\n\nEclair relies on Bitcoin Core to interact with and monitor the Bitcoin blockchain and manage on-chain funds. It does not include its own on-chain wallet. Channel opening transactions are funded by your Bitcoin Core node, and when a channel is closed, the funds are returned to your Bitcoin Core node. This means that Eclair benefits from the features and optimizations implemented by Bitcoin Core, such as fee management with RBF/CPFP (Replace-By-Fee / Child-Pays-For-Parent).\n\nTo run Eclair, you need to install Java, preferably OpenJDK 11. You can then download the latest release of Eclair, unzip the archive, and run the program using a command in the terminal or command prompt. Once Eclair is running, you can control your node using the eclair-cli command line tool or by making HTTP requests to the API.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly read the official documentation before running your own Eclair node, as outdated or incomplete tutorials or guides may lead to issues or security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe configuration file for Eclair is located in the \"~/.eclair\" directory. To change the node's configuration, you can create a file named \"eclair.conf\" in the \"~/.eclair\" directory and specify the desired configuration parameters. For example, you can configure Eclair to use a different Bitcoin Core wallet than the default one.\n\nIt's crucial to back up your Bitcoin Core wallet and your Eclair node regularly. For Bitcoin Core, you need to back up the wallet file, and for Eclair, you need to back up the \"eclair.sqlite.bak\" file located in your data directory. Your seeds, which are used to derive your cryptographic keys, remain the same, but your channels can change whenever you send or receive payments.\n\nEclair also supports plugins written in Scala, Java, or any JVM-compatible language. These plugins can extend the functionality of Eclair and enable additional features.\n\nBy default, Eclair is configured to run on the Bitcoin mainnet, but you can also run it on testnet, regtest, or signet by modifying the configuration parameters.\n\nThese are the key details about Eclair and its usage. It's important to refer to the official documentation for more detailed and up-to-date information.",

The PR is mentioned in the newsletter, which brings recognition to the contributor.\n\nOne important point to note is that the API is specifically designed for managing your node and the goal is not to maintain too many unused APIs. While the API provides access to historic channel data, it is intended for basic management purposes. For more exotic use-cases or in-depth analysis, it is recommended to directly interface with the database, preferably the read-only replicated DB to ensure minimal impact on the running node.\n\nThe contributor emphasizes that it is essential to be able to know what happened with their own money and managing their node requires access to this information. They argue that accessing historic channel data is not an exotic use-case but rather an essential part of managing a node.\n\nThe PR states that the required code and data already exist and it only requires a few lines of code to put them together and make the historic channel data accessible.\n\nThe contributor also mentions that this is not the first time there has been a suggestion to access the database directly. However, there are two problems with this approach. Firstly, the JSON format of the data is not documented, but users can use their intelligence to figure out the structure. Secondly, the contributor uses Python for their automation scripts and asks for guidance on how to write a script that can determine if a channel has been force-closed using the data from the PR.\n\nIn response to a suggestion about listing all closed channels, the contributor agrees that the list of closed channels can become very large over time and listing everything at once can be problematic. They propose adding pagination and making the count parameter mandatory to avoid potential issues.\n\nThe PR mentions that merging it will increase the code coverage by 0.00% and the diff coverage is 70.00%.\n\nThere is a notification informing the organization that they are not using the GitHub App Integration and may experience degraded service starting from May 15th.\n\nThe contributor suggests that performance concerns for nodes with a large amount of historical data can be addressed later by optimizing the storage of closed channels in a separate table.\n\nFinally, the contributor expresses satisfaction with the progress of the PR, stating that there are only a few comments on the changes in the database files but overall, the PR looks good to them.

This merge is expected to increase the coverage of the project by 0.08%. The diff coverage is specified as 95.39%.\n\nA warning is given that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration, which may lead to degraded service starting from May 15th. Therefore, it is recommended to install the GitHub App Integration for the organization to avoid any issues.\n\nThe passage also mentions that the task at hand turned out to be more complex than initially anticipated. Simplifications and refactorings have been proposed in another pull request (#2663), bringing the project closer to a minimum viable product (MVP) release.\n\nThere is a mention of merging improvements made by someone, but the routing algorithms for messages and payments are kept separate. It is considered easier to have separate algorithms for these tasks, rather than attempting to create a generic solution.\n\nThe usage of Dijkstra algorithm for message routing is also mentioned. The algorithm prioritizes big channels, old channels, and penalizes disabled edges (although still considering them). The pull request has been rebased on the master branch to resolve any conflicts.\n\nThe passage mentions that the changes proposed in the pull request are mostly good, but it is difficult to determine potential performance regressions. As this component is critical, it is suggested to exclude the pull request from the release. Instead, it is recommended to spend time testing it on the node before releasing it. The release will be made first, and then the pull request will be merged into the master branch after the release, along with performance benchmarks.\n\nThere is a performance comparison mentioned with the changes made. The execution time for certain functions has increased or decreased. The DirectedGraph.makeGraph function now takes 653ms instead of 225ms, the .addEdges function takes 356ms instead of 2.676s, and yenKshortestPaths function takes 2.578s instead of 2.345s.\n\nRegarding the changes in DirectedGraph.makeGraph, it is mentioned that writing ad hoc code for it may not be worth it, as it is only called once at startup. Storing edges in a map instead of a list has a slight impact on path-finding time but significantly improves the update time.\n\nThe feedback given on the code is positive, stating that the code is looking good and the work done so far is commendable. The person providing the feedback plans to spend more time on the benchmarks and report on the results early next week.\n\nFinally, it is noted that successfully merging the pull request may close certain issues.

They found that routing messages is too different from routing payments, and it is simpler to have separate algorithms for each.\n\nThey mention that they are now using Dijkstra's algorithm for message routing as well. They can prioritize big channels, old channels, and penalize disabled edges, but still consider them. They mentioned rebasing on the master branch to fix a conflict.\n\nNext, the author mentions that the code looks mostly good, but they are unsure about potential performance regressions, especially since this is a critical component. They suggest leaving this pull request out of the release and testing it on their node before releasing it. They plan to make the release first and then merge this pull request to the master branch after the release and after conducting performance benchmarks.\n\nThe author then provides some performance statistics. They mention that the DirectedGraph.makeGraph function now takes 653ms instead of 225ms, which is 2.9 times longer. The .addEdges function now takes 356ms instead of 2.676s, which is a 0.13 times improvement. The yenKshortestPaths function now takes 2.578s compared to 2.345s before, which is a 1.1 times increase in time.\n\nThey mention that they don't think writing ad hoc code for DirectedGraph.makeGraph is worth it since it is only called once at start-up.

These are blockchain technologies that are used in the project. They mention that the network is increasing the values of a specific parameter called `cltv_expiry_delta` to address high on-chain fees. This adjustment is necessary to avoid rejecting payments. \n\nThe writer then discusses a software development process known as merging, where changes made in one branch of a code repository are combined with the main branch. They mention that a specific merge (identified as #2677) will decrease code coverage by 0.01%. Code coverage refers to the percentage of code that has been tested. In this case, the decrease in coverage may be because of the merge.

More information can be found by reading the provided link.\n\nThe writer then brings up a concern about the code. They mention a specific file, `Channel.scala`, and express their opinion that having many constants defined in different places is problematic. They suggest that the constant `MAX_CLTV_EXPIRY_DELTA` should be read from `nodeParams` instead of being a hidden constant in the code. They also question the necessity of another constant called `DEFAULT_ROUTE_MAX_CLTV` and express uncertainty about what to do with it.\n\nIn response to this, another person agrees with the writer's points and states that they have cleaned up the constants in `Channel.scala`. However, they are unsure about what to do with `DEFAULT_ROUTE_MAX_CLTV` in the Router component. They feel that if the maximum expiry delta of a channel is to be reused, the Channel Configuration (`ChannelConf`) needs to be provided to path-finding, which they find odd.\n\nThe text ends with the statement that the change looks good to them, but they will need to review it again after the weekend to be certain.

It begins by stating that the team or organization values feedback from users and takes it seriously. They encourage users to provide their input by creating a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers of the project.\n\nThe next part suggests a specific change to the project. The proposal is to remove the \"FeeEstimator\" abstraction and replace it with an \"AtomicReference\" to store and update the current fee rates. This change is similar to how the block count is stored. By using an AtomicReference, the fee rates can be easily updated and accessed.\n\nThe text then mentions a specific pull request (#2696) that is being merged into the main codebase (master). It states that this merge will decrease the test coverage of the code by 0.08%. The \"test coverage\" refers to how much of the code is covered by automated tests. The lower the coverage percentage, the less code is being tested. The \"diff coverage\" refers to the percentage of code that has been modified in the pull request.\n\nAfter that, there is a warning message indicating that the organization is not utilizing the GitHub App Integration. The text suggests that this may lead to degraded service starting from May 15th. It advises installing the GitHub App Integration for better service.\n\nThe text then discusses the topic of default fee rates. It mentions that the default fee rates should be removed, but acknowledges that there may be reasons for them to exist. The reasons are not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that they are related to handling Bitcoind restarts and avoiding frequent database calls. It suggests that external input from the node operator (the person managing the node) is needed to provide the fee rates.\n\nThe last part states that successfully merging this pull request may resolve some issues. It also includes a coverage diff, showing the changes in test coverage after the pull request is merged. It mentions that the coverage will decrease by 0.08%. The final statement suggests moving away from the \"block target\" approach and using satoshis-per-byte as the unit for fee rates.\n\nI hope this explanation provides a clear understanding of the given text!",

An AtomicReference is a type of variable that can be updated atomically (all at once), ensuring that other threads or processes accessing the variable do not see any intermediate states.\n\nThe reason for this change is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, but it seems that the current approach of using a FeeEstimator may have some issues or limitations. The statement mentions that the default fee rates, which are currently being used, should be removed. There may be two reasons why the default fee rates currently exist, but these reasons are not explained.\n\nThe statement also mentions that there is a need for external input from the node operator, which suggests that the fee rates may need to be set by the operator rather than being hardcoded. The idea is to avoid frequent database calls to retrieve the latest fee rates and instead rely on external input.\n\nThe statement also includes some technical information about the merge request, such as the coverage difference (which is a measure of how much of the code is covered by tests) and the diff coverage (which is the percentage of code changes that are covered by tests).\n\nOverall, the suggestion is to make changes to the code related to fee estimation in order to improve the functionality and flexibility of the project.",

It supports various functionalities such as data persistence, chain interactions, and networking. These features can be provided by the library's sample modules, or users can provide their own custom implementations.\n\nThe library fully implements the BOLT specifications, which are the specifications for the Lightning Network protocol. It has been used in production since 2021. However, it is important to handle deployment with care and attention to detail to ensure safe usage.\n\nCommunications and discussions about rust-lightning and the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) happen through LDK Discord channels. The LDK project offers sample code for a node that fetches blockchain data and manages on-chain funds using the Bitcoin Core RPC/REST interface. The code is available on GitHub and provides composable components that can be customized based on specific needs.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that rust-lightning does not provide certain features, but the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) has implementations for them. The LDK project aims to provide a highly customizable Lightning implementation, allowing users to choose how they want to use it. The library exposes its functionalities through simple and composable APIs.\n\nTo ensure security, it is advised not to add new dependencies to the library. The developers discourage adding non-optional, non-test, or non-library dependencies. Furthermore, it is recommended to reduce the usage of dependencies in the \"rust-bitcoin\" library.\n\nThe term \"rust-lightning\" is used to refer to the core lightning crate within the repository, while \"LDK\" encompasses rust-lightning and all its sample modules, language bindings, sample node implementations, and other tools related to Lightning integration or building a Lightning node.\n\nContributors are welcome to participate in the project, and more information can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Additionally, the project provides an ARCH.md file that introduces the high-level API of rust-lightning.\n\nThe library is available under the Apache-2.0 or MIT license, at the option of the user, meaning that users can choose which license to use for their specific needs.",

      "summary": "In this conversation, a developer is discussing a code review with another developer. The code in question is related to managing channels in a project. Let's break down the conversation and explain each part in detail:\n\n1. We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\n   - The team values feedback and takes it seriously.\n\n2. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation.\n   - The developer is referring to the project's documentation, where all qualifiers are listed.\n\n3. Have a question about this project? Sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact its maintainers and the community.\n   - The developer suggests creating a GitHub account to ask questions and open issues related to the project.\n\n4. By clicking “Sign up for GitHub”, you agree to our terms of service and privacy statement. We’ll occasionally send you account related emails.\n   - This is a standard message displayed when signing up for a GitHub account.\n\n5. Currently, funded and unfunded channels are represented by a single Channel struct. This ends up conflating certain state and makes it harder to reason about / less safe to call appropriate methods on Channel to advance state.\n   - The current implementation of the Channel struct combines funded and unfunded channels, which makes it difficult to handle the different states and call the appropriate methods.\n\n6. Does it make sense to drop the ChannelKind enum and instead just actually have three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager?\n   - The developer is suggesting dropping the ChannelKind enum and using three separate maps for channels instead. This could make the code more clear and easier to reason about.\n\n7. Without having actually reviewed the mega-diff, and aside from that, this LGTM. It would be really nice to split this up into at least like 2 or three commits - maybe first create the context object in a regular channel, then add the trait, then split or something like that?\n   - The developer gives their overall approval, but suggests splitting up the code changes into smaller, more manageable commits. They propose an example order for the commits.\n\n8. We'll want to coordinate on landing this, I think, given its going to conflict with the world. Get some concept ACKs, then all get online at once for an hour or two and get it landed.\n   - The developer suggests coordinating with the team to ensure a smooth integration, as this code change is expected to cause conflicts. They propose a plan to get everyone online simultaneously to resolve any issues and merge the code.\n\n9. So I started this way actually, and it did seem simpler up until it concerned me a little when we're at the stage where we have the channel promoted when funding is generated/signed, and it seems a bit disjoint handling a second map while you're busy with an OccupiedEntry as there are quite a few such cases.\n   - The developer reflects on their initial approach, which involved using separate maps for channels. However, they express concern about the complexity of handling a second map while dealing with occupied entries during the promotion of a channel.\n\n10. Close to having this split, but with the way I'm doing things with the ChannelContext currently as a field with a getter, I'm really trying to avoid RefCell which seems to want to crop its head up due to constraints with some of the common method signatures. Will try some different patterns, otherwise will push the split (but still kinda broken) changes for ideas.\n    - The developer is working on the code split but explains a challenge they faced with ChannelContext. They are trying to avoid using RefCell due to constraints with some common method signatures. They plan to try other patterns and, if necessary, push the broken split changes to get feedback and ideas.\n\n11. Hmm, not sure why interior mutability is cropping up? When we're converting from one channel to another we should have full ownership of the object, no?\n    - The developer expresses confusion about encountering interior mutability. They mention that when converting from one channel to another, they should have full ownership of the object, so interior mutability shouldn't be necessary.\n\n12. I'll push up some stuff in the morning. Better than my lame explanation :P\n    - The developer plans to make some code changes the next day, acknowledging that it will be better than their current explanation.\n\n13. I guess we should call the structs InitiatorChannel and InitiateeChannel rather than inbound/outbound? Is there not sufficient functionality overlap between the initiator/initiatee sides that we should just have the same PreFundingChannel?\n    - The developer suggests renaming the current structs to InitiatorChannel and InitiateeChannel instead of using inbound/outbound. They also question if there is enough functionality overlap between the initiator and initiatee sides, suggesting the possibility of having the same PreFundingChannel for both.\n\n14. Lol who knew channel refactoring would be painfully trickier than thought?\n    - The developer expresses humor and surprise at the unexpected difficulty they encountered during the channel refactoring process.\n\n15. With the multi-chan-to-id-map approach, there are a bunch of assumptions on the channel_by_id map to be made. It seems quite easy for an uncovered bug to slip through with a refactor.\n    - The developer points out potential issues with the multi-chan-to-id-map approach, mentioning that there are many assumptions made about the channel_by_id map. They also express concern that a bug could be easily overlooked during a refactoring process.\n\n16. I feel like there will be less surface area for bugs this way since we'd be touching a lot less. And the case of review and merge conflicts being crazy.\n    - The developer argues that the separate maps approach would reduce the potential for bugs since there would be less code to touch. They also mention that it would make the review and merge conflict resolution process less challenging.\n\n17. I mean we totally could have just one struct for prefunded channels, as tracking who the initiator is will be kept in the context of the InteractiveTxConstructor struct. However, we still end up with the situation for methods involving accept/open that do not overlap and would be nice to have some type-safety around those two in the form of different structs.\n    - The developer contemplates the possibility of having a single struct for prefunded channels, but acknowledges the need for different structs to provide type safety and handle the accept/open methods that don't overlap.\n\n18. Ah, okay, yea, I guess that makes sense, I just wanted to check that those methods aren't becoming more symmetric and the design would only make sense for legacy channels. If the design only makes sense for them and not v2 channels, I'm okay with the awkwardness for legacy, ultimately up to you, as long as it makes some sense for v2 channels.\n    - The developer confirms that the design decision for separate structs makes sense and acknowledges the potential asymmetry in the methods. They express their acceptance of the awkwardness for legacy channels if it provides better structure and sense for v2 channels.\n\n19. Thanks for another general review pass. The last commit is admittedly still not great for review. Thinking about splitting it up more. There's also some duplication I'm not super happy with now.\n    - The developer expresses appreciation for the review and mentions that the last commit may not be ideal for review. They plan to further split the code and address some duplication that they are not satisfied with.\n\n20. Spent the last while deduplicating some things in the final commit and resolving some nasty borrow conflicts and it's taken way longer than anticipated, but it has made me realize that we probably don't need to worry about generalizing things too much.\n    - The developer explains that they spent time deduplicating code and resolving borrow conflicts, which took longer than expected. However, they realized that there is no need to overgeneralize the code.\n\n21. When we encounter issues with Inbound/Outbound channels those are only ever \"Close\", but all we ever really need to do is discard and clean up maps. I've been able to simplify some things because of this and will get it up when all the tests are happy. There are a lot of moving parts and I regret touching this lol.\n    - The developer highlights that issues with inbound/outbound channels usually only involve \"Close\" actions, which can be handled by discarding and cleaning up maps. They mention simplifying some code as a result and express regret over the complexity of the changes.\n\n22. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n23. Didn't super carefully review all the channel motion, but generally LGTM.\n    - The developer admits not reviewing the channel motion thoroughly but still gives a \"Looks Good To Me\" (LGTM) response.\n\n24. Thanks for another general review pass. The last commit is admittedly still not great for review. Thinking about splitting it up more. There's also some duplication I'm not super happy with now.\n    - This is a repeated comment from earlier in the conversation.\n\n25. I think I will revert to having OutboundV1Channel::funding_signed on Channel::funding_signed so that at least we have temp_chan_id and chan_id consistency in the maps. Adding an extra state in between will clear be a better solution. Luckily there's room to do that in a further PR.\n    - The developer mentions their plan to revert a particular change and bring back consistency between temp_chan_id and chan_id in the maps. They also propose a better solution involving an additional state between the temporary and final channel states.\n\n26. I know it's not ideal with the splits we have now, but would we be okay with moving funding_signed back to Channel, @wpaulino? :)\n    - The developer asks for approval to move the funding_signed method back to the Channel struct, addressing the concern previously discussed.\n\n27. There's a couple occurrences of this that aren't necessary. Should reduce the changeset to use self instead.\n    - The developer suggests removing unnecessary occurrences of a particular variable and advises reducing the size of the code changes by using \"self\" instead.\n\n28. Yeah, I initially did this as a pre-diff to reduce interleaving on a large diff, but ended up breaking it up anyway, so can remove.\n    - The developer explains that they initially used the variable to reduce interleaving in a large diff but ended up breaking it up regardless. They agree to remove the variable.\n\n29. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n30. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n31. Will address these in a follow-up I think. I believe they still make the diffs that follow more readable without interleaving.\n    - The developer plans to address the mentioned issues in a separate follow-up commit, believing that it will result in more readable code changes without interleaving.\n\n32. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n33. IIUC, OutboundV1Channel and InboundV1Channel can neither be in this state. Thus, it's fine that we ignore the corresponding maps when writing ChannelManager. As of now Channel may or not be in this state, though. Going forward, what should be represented as a ChannelState variant vs defined by a specific channel struct type? I think preferably we don't have redundant state to avoid inconsistency.\n    - The developer provides their understanding that OutboundV1Channel and InboundV1Channel cannot be in the mentioned state. They clarify that it's acceptable to ignore the corresponding maps in the ChannelManager. However, they raise a question about representing ChannelState variants and avoiding redundant state to prevent inconsistency.\n\n34. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n35. This would make sense just to have in Channel. I'll leave it as is for now and address it in a further \"remove redundant state\" PR.\n    - The developer agrees that it would be logical to have the mentioned code in the Channel struct. They decide to leave it as is for now and tackle it in a separate pull request focused on removing redundant state.\n\n36. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n37. Not really a huge fan of putting this back here, would kinda rather put it in channel_by_id here - indeed we don't have a monitor for this channel yet (we'll get one when we receive a funding_signed) but it does have a \"real\" channel_id at this point, and we have generated a funding tx which we need to pass a FundingAbandoned event for if we fail.\n    - The developer expresses their preference for placing the code in a different location. They explain the reason for the preference and mention the necessity of passing a FundingAbandoned event if the funding transaction fails.\n\n38.

From when I attempted making it a context 🤦‍♂️\n    - The developer acknowledges the truth of a previous statement and attributes it to their attempt to make it a context.\n\n43. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\n    - This comment is a placeholder and does not provide any relevant information.\n\n44. This is now only called once, we should probably try to re-condense with list_channels or just drop this and inline it in its callsite.\n    - The developer suggests re-evaluating the need for a particular method, either by condensing it with list_channels or removing it and incorporating it directly into its callsite.\n\n45. I mean maybe that's true, but let's definitely fix this in a followup to handle the warn/ignore cases properly.\n    - The developer acknowledges a potential issue and suggests addressing it in a follow-up commit to handle the warn/ignore cases correctly.\n\n46. This commit also adds two new maps to `PeerState` for keeping track of `OutboundV1Channel`s and `InboundV1Channel`s so that further commits are a bit easier to review.\n    - The developer adds two new maps to the PeerState struct to keep track of OutboundV1Channels and InboundV1Channels. This will make subsequent commits easier to review.\n\n47. I don't think this split should go in this PR, though, we're delayed enough as it is, but there's lots more splitting to do in the future.\n    - The developer suggests not including the split mentioned, as it would further delay the pull request. They acknowledge the need for additional splitting in the future.\n\n48. Looking forward, that further split makes sense and we might introduce enums for the maps if it makes that easier but not super necessary.\n    - The developer acknowledges the sense in further splitting the code and considers the possibility of introducing enums for the maps to simplify the code.\n\n49. I think I will revert to having OutboundV1Channel::funding_signed on Channel::funding_signed so that at least we have temp_chan_id and chan_id consistency in the maps. Adding an extra state in between will clear be a better solution. Luckily, there's room to do that in a further PR.\n    - The developer confirms their decision to revert the previous change and restore the consistency between temp_chan_id and chan_id in the maps. They express optimism about a better solution involving an additional state in a future pull request.\n\n50. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

Sadly there's a handful of places in channelmanager where we are only looking at channel_by_id and need to update to look at the other maps. Can you open a followups issue so that we can track these and @wpaulino's comments and make sure we hit at least the bugs before 0.0.116?\n    - The developer gives their final approval for merging the pull request, but points out that there are certain places in the channelmanager code that only consider channel_by_id and need to be updated to include the other maps. They request opening a follow-up issue to track these changes and address @wpaulino's comments to ensure they are resolved before the next release, version 0.0.116.",

      "summary": "The passage you provided is an excerpt from a technical document that is discussing a proposed feature implementation. It appears to be related to a project involving Bitcoin or a similar cryptocurrency. The document discusses the implementation details of a feature that allows users to bump their commitments and HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contract) transactions. \n\nHere is a breakdown of the key points mentioned in the passage:\n\n- Reading and considering user feedback is important, and the developers take it seriously.\n- There is a need for documentation to explain all the available qualifiers for the project.\n- Questions about the project can be asked by signing up for a free GitHub account and opening an issue to contact the maintainers and the community.\n- The developers want to simplify the process of bumping commitments and HTLC transactions for users. They are proposing implementing a small \"shim\" over the users' wallet or UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) source. This shim would give permission to the event handler to spend confirmed UTXOs for the transactions it will produce.\n- There is a discussion about potential limitations or issues with the proposed solution. These include not satisfying certain Replace-By-Fee (RBF) mempool policy requirements and the need to modify ongoing nversion=3 rules to avoid complexity. There is also a mention of abstracting descriptors to enable signing of lightning transactions on hardware devices.\n- There is a suggestion to use the coin selection abstractions in Bitcoin Core's fundrawtransaction and other wallet RPC calls to avoid re-implementing confidentiality hardening.\n- There is a plan to improve the CoinSelectionSource implementation by introducing a new event that can be consumed by the CoinSelectionSource to reorganize the allocated UTXOs based on priorities.\n- The coverage of the code and the need to upload reports for accurate results is mentioned.\n- There is a discussion about the CoinSelectionSource implementation and the need for better documentation. The dynamic computation of ClaimId is brought up as a potential improvement in the future.\n- The need to round up a value in the code is mentioned, as well as the risk of crashes if certain conditions are not handled properly.\n- The potential impact of turning off the datacarrier option on a full node's propagation of anchor CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) is discussed.\n- The importance of adding debug assertions and testing the weight estimation code is mentioned.\n- There is a suggestion to add comments to clarify certain parts of the code.\n- The need for another approving review and the mention of potential issues with crashing and fuzzer testing are brought up.\n- The need to document the requirement to not turn off the datacarrier option on a full node is mentioned.\n- The need to add debug assertions post-signing to check the weight is as expected is discussed.\n- There is a discussion about the saturation of multiplication operations and the potential for crashes in certain scenarios.\n- The need for careful testing and assertions to ensure the safe advancement of the state machine is mentioned.\n- The suggestion to include a final debug_assert and a lower-bound weight check in the weight estimation code is made.\n- The fact that the code is anchor output only and not yet activated is mentioned.\n- The need for another approving review and the discussion of potential crashes are mentioned again.\n- The need for debug assertions post-signing to check the weight is as expected is reiterated.\n- A comparison is made to the previous implementation and the observation that the commitment_tx_fee is overpaid is made.\n- The suggestion to add a comment explaining the need to separately call the sign method for the HTLC and call its descriptor to obtain the witness is made.\n- The potential crash scenario in regard to fee_sat being u64::max is discussed, and the suggestion to use saturating methods is made. However, it is mentioned that such a fee is not possible in the protocol.\n- The discussion about potential crashes and testing with a fuzzer is mentioned again.\n- The approval of the current version with the mention of the need for a follow-up review is given.\n- The need to round up a value in the code is mentioned again.\n- The potential crash scenario in regard to fee_sat being u64::max is discussed again.\n\nOverall, the passage delves into the technical details and various considerations related to the proposed feature implementation. It seems to involve multiple aspects such as wallet/UTXO management, fee-bumping, mempool policy requirements, and testing.",
      "summaryeli15": "This pull request is proposing changes to the Lightning Network Daemon (LDK) library in order to allow users to bump their commitments and HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contract) transactions without worrying about the intricate details involved. Instead, users would only need to implement a small interface over their wallet or UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) source, granting permission to spend confirmed UTXOs for the transactions the event handler will produce.\n\nThe proposed changes include the introduction of a new trait called `CoinSelectionSource`, which users can implement to provide a transaction \"template\" to the event handler. This trait defines methods for selecting confirmed UTXOs, determining the inputs and outputs of the transaction, and signing and broadcasting the transaction. By implementing this trait, users can customize the transaction creation process according to their specific wallet or UTXO management needs.\n\nIn addition to the `CoinSelectionSource` trait, the pull request also introduces the `WalletSource` trait as an alternative for users who may not have control over the UTXO selection process in their wallet. The `WalletSource` trait simply provides a list of confirmed UTXOs that can be used for the transaction. This trait is consumed by a wrapper called `Wallet`, which implements the `CoinSelectionSource` trait using a simple coin selection algorithm that prioritizes UTXOs with a value above the dust threshold.\n\nThe pull request also includes documentation updates and test coverage, ensuring that the changes are well-documented and thoroughly tested. Feedback has been provided by multiple reviewers, and additional follow-up work is planned to address their concerns and suggestions before the changes are merged into the main codebase.",

The phrase \"Learn more\" suggests that more information or context can be obtained regarding the comment.\n\n12. \"We should definitely land at least the new serialization backwards-incompatible hints tlvs for the next release.\" - This comment suggests that the team is planning to introduce new serialization backward-incompatible hints in the next release of the project. The phrase \"land at least\" indicates that there may be additional changes or updates in the release.\n\n13. \"Should this get some kind of TODO? Or should we just always use this path directly?\" - This comment raises a question regarding whether a certain task or code segment should be marked as a TODO (a reminder for future action) or if it should be used directly without any modifications.\n\n14. \"We can't use these paths atm because get_route doesn't have the ability to 'advance' the blinded path to the next hop (and we can't pathfind to ourselves, ofc). Previously discussed here: #2146 (comment)\" - This comment explains the reason why certain paths cannot be used at the moment. It states that the method \"get_route\" does not have the capability to advance the blinded path to the next hop, and pathfinding to oneself is not possible either. It refers to a previous discussion for additional context.\n\n15. \"Ah, I misunderstood that comment, so I think there's another way to handle this - let get_route return early with a 0-hop unblinded path portion and the blinded tail as-is. Then the paying code would handle it by detecting this case and doing the advancing itself.\" - This comment acknowledges a misunderstanding and proposes an alternative approach to handling a specific situation. The suggestion is to modify the \"get_route\" method to return a 0-hop unblinded path portion and leave the blinded tail unchanged. The payer code would then be responsible for detecting this case and advancing the path accordingly.\n\n16. \"Hmm, I don't see how that would work if the max_htlc of the 1 blinded hint isn't sufficient for the entire payment?\" - This comment expresses doubt and raises a concern about the feasibility of the proposed approach. It questions how the suggested solution would work if the maximum HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract) value of the first blinded hint is not sufficient to cover the entire payment.\n\n17. \"Mmm right, I suppose we could pre-select it as a path and then run the router to select more paths if needed? That seems like it would work pretty easy.\" - This comment reflects agreement with a previously expressed idea. It suggests that the first blinded hint could be pre-selected as a path and then the router could be executed to select additional paths if necessary. The commenter believes that this approach would be relatively straightforward.\n\n18. \"Yeah that sounds good! We might want to have another prefactor, though, because there's still assumptions that path.hops.len() > 0 scattered around. Will look into that.\" - This comment indicates agreement with a previous suggestion. It suggests the possibility of adding another prefactor (a code refactoring) to handle the current assumptions related to the length of \"path.hops\". The commenter plans to investigate this further.\n\n19. \"For (1), we could decrement each of our available channel balances by the amount used on the path. Not sure it's if worth the additional complexity.\" - This comment suggests a possible solution for an issue labeled as \"(1)\". It proposes decrementing the available channel balances by the amount used on the path. However, the commenter expresses uncertainty about whether this approach is worth the additional complexity it might introduce.\n\n20. \"I'm gonna address this in a follow-up since this PR is growing. IMO our offers code should still advance blinded paths before pathfinding to them, though adding the behavior you describe is good for keeping find_route general-purpose\" - This comment states the commenter's plan to address a certain issue in a future follow-up. It mentions that the offers code should advance blinded paths before pathfinding, but adding the behavior described by the previous comment is beneficial for maintaining the generality of the \"find_route\" function.\n\n21. \"More of a comprehension question - if a recipient includes a dummy hop, we'll send extra sats for this dummy hop's fees that will go to the recipient right? Is there anything stopping a recipient from always making a sender slightly overpay as long as there's a route with enough liquidity?\" - This comment poses a question related to the behavior of including a dummy hop in the payment route. It asks whether sending extra satoshis for the dummy hop's fees will go to the recipient. It also raises a concern about the possibility of a recipient consistently making the sender slightly overpay as long as there is a route with sufficient liquidity.\n\n22. \"I realize reading more of the proposal that recipients are even encouraged to in order to avoid probing, although I also saw this section where the recipient pays the blinded fees which was interesting. But yea, seems like nothing's really stopping a recipient from getting the sender to overpay as long as it's not outrageous...🤷\" - This comment reflects the commenter's increased understanding of the proposal. It mentions that recipients are encouraged to make senders overpay to avoid probing. The commenter also notes a section in the proposal where the recipient pays the blinded fees and finds it interesting. It concludes by stating that there is nothing explicitly preventing a recipient from getting the sender to overpay, as long as it is not an excessive amount. The shrugging emoji 🤷 conveys a sense of uncertainty or indifference.\n\n23. \"Largely looks good though I need to do a more detailed pass at the last commit still.\" - This comment indicates that the commenter has reviewed the project and believes that it looks good overall. However, they plan to conduct a more thorough examination of the last commit to ensure its quality.\n\n24. \"One small thing worth fixing in a follow-up, though I'm not even sure the code is actually reachable.\" - This comment suggests that there is a minor issue that should be fixed in a future follow-up. The commenter also expresses uncertainty about whether the code in question is even accessible or executed.\n\n25. \"Successfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\" - This statement informs that successfully merging the pull request may result in the closure of certain identified issues. It highlights the potential impact of the pull request on the project's issue tracking system.\n\n26. \"@@ Coverage Diff @@ ## main #2120 +/- ## ========================================== + Coverage 90.48% 91.30% +0.81% ========================================== Files 104 106 +2 Lines 53920 63000 +9080 Branches 53920 63000 +9080 ========================================== + Hits 48792 57525 +8733 - Misses 5128 5475 +347\" - This block provides a coverage difference report.

      "summaryeli15": "This pull request is implementing support for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages and replying to onion messages in the Rust Lightning Network library. The aim is to enable the library to handle Offers messages and provide a response to onion messages.\n\nThe pull request consists of several commits that make various changes to the codebase. Let's go through the important parts of the pull request:\n\n1. The initial commit adds the necessary types and parsing/encoding functionality for BOLT 12 Offers messages. It introduces the OnionMessageContents struct, which will hold the contents of onion messages, and defines an error type for semantic errors when parsing the messages. This commit also adds a trait called OffersMessageHandler to handle BOLT 12 Offers messages and implements it for the ChannelManager.\n\n2. The next commit introduces the OnionMessagePath struct, which represents a path for an onion message. It includes the intermediate nodes and the destination of the message. This struct is used in the OnionMessenger's send_onion_message method to specify the path for the message.\n\n3. Another commit adds the FindRoute trait, which is used to find routes for onion messages. The OnionMessenger is parameterized with this trait, allowing it to find routes and reply to messages using the provided route. The commit also updates the OnionMessageHandlers to return an optional response message for the OnionMessenger to reply with.\n\n4. The next commit fixes some issues with the fuzzing data generation for onion messages. Previously, the same public key was used for each node, causing problems when determining the reply path for onion messages. The commit addresses this issue by using different node secrets for each node.\n\nOverall, this pull request adds support for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages and replying to onion messages in the Rust Lightning Network library. The changes include the addition of new types, traits, and methods, as well as updates to existing code to accommodate the new functionality.",

They are unsure if a release note is enough to inform users about this change and are open to suggestions on how to handle it.\n- There is a discussion about a potential inaccuracy in reporting the skimmed fee when the counterparty (the other party involved in the transaction) exceeds the expected amount in the transaction. The commenter raises this issue and notes that it may not happen often and the impact may not be significant, but they thought it was worth mentioning.\n- Another commenter acknowledges the potential inaccuracy and suggests that it may not be possible to detect if a non-penultimate intermediate node took less fee than intended by the sender. They note that there are limited parameters available to work with in this case.\n- The commenter suggests a possible solution to include the skimmed fee in a certain function and use it for calculations. They are unsure if it's worth implementing in the current context and ask for opinions on this.\n- There is a discussion about the possibility of an intermediary node causing a payment to fail by not taking enough fee. The suggestion is that this information could be used to determine if the destination node is a recent Large-Scale Payments (LSP) client or just a routing node peer.\n- The commenter mentions that they have made some changes to address the issue and asks for a review.\n- There is a suggestion to expose a certain field via the PaymentClaimed event. It's unclear what this field represents, but the commenter believes it would be beneficial to include it.\n- The comment is repeated twice, suggesting that the commenter may have made a duplicate submission by accident.\n- There is a suggestion to include a check for a resulting amount of zero and a discussion about whether failing the transaction in this case is necessary.\n- The commenter mentions that they have rebased the project to resolve conflicts.\n- Another commenter approves the changes made, with one real comment and a minor suggestion to squash some commits.\n- There is a discussion about a potential attack scenario related to the skimmed fee being too high and the possibility of it causing a payment to fail. It is noted that the current documentation only mentions checking the amount, but the commenter mentions the issue for consideration.\n- The commenter clarifies that if the fee skimmed is too high, it means the immediately-prior node took too much, and if a node prior to that took too much, it should result in the second-to-last hop taking too little.\n- The commenter acknowledges their previous mistake in thinking that intermediate nodes could still affect the final skimmed fee.\n- A follow-up suggestion is made to support setting a specific parameter. The commenter mentions that if someone is an LSP and wants to be the first payment to a certain client, they would need this parameter to take a fee on the first hop. It is noted that the current functionality may not allow sending a payment to an intercept SCID (an identifier related to routing).\n- The commenter mentions that merging the pull request may close certain issues.\n- The commenter notes that the channel lock is needed to construct a pending HTLC's status because it is necessary to know if the channel accepts underpaying HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) in upcoming commits.\n- There is a reference to a specific function (ChannelConfig::accept_underpaying_htlcs) that relates to the previous mention of underpaying HTLCs.\n- The comment mentions that receivers need to use a specific value to verify incoming payments if the channel accepts underpaying HTLCs.",

The project utilizes the btcsuite set of Bitcoin libraries and also offers isolated re-usable Lightning Network libraries.\n\nThe Lightning Network specification, known as BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology), is being developed by multiple implementers worldwide, including the developers of lnd. While the specification and implementation are still a work-in-progress, lnd aims to fully conform to the Lightning Network specification.\n\nlnd is designed to be developer-friendly and provides two primary RPC interfaces: an HTTP REST API and a gRPC service. It's important to note that these APIs are not yet stable and may undergo significant changes in the future. Detailed documentation for the RPC APIs is available at api.lightning.community, and additional developer resources can be found at docs.lightning.engineering.\n\nThe lnd team maintains an active Slack community where protocol developers, application developers, testers, and users can discuss various aspects of lnd and Lightning Network.\n\nFor building lnd from source, installation instructions are provided. Additionally, Docker instructions are available for running lnd in a containerized environment.\n\nWhen operating a mainnet lnd node, the project recommends referring to operational safety guidelines to ensure the secure handling of funds. It's crucial to acknowledge that lnd is still in beta and not following these guidelines may result in potential fund loss.\n\nThe developers of lnd prioritize security and appreciate the responsible disclosure of any security or privacy-related issues. They encourage individuals to report such vulnerabilities by sending an email to security@lightning.engineering. Preferably, encryption should be used with their designated PGP key (91FE464CD75101DA6B6BAB60555C6465E5BCB3AF).\n\nFinally, the statement concludes by mentioning the addition of a GPG key for hieblmi in the scripts, indicating a specific update made to the project.",
      "summaryeli15": "The excerpt you provided is a description of the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd), which is a software program that functions as a Lightning Network node. The Lightning Network is a second-layer scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain that aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe lnd software is built to adhere to the Lightning Network specification, which is a set of rules and protocols that define how Lightning Network nodes should operate. The specification is being developed by multiple groups, including the developers of lnd themselves. However, both the specification and the implementation of lnd are still under development and may change in the future.\n\nTo assist developers in building applications on top of lnd, the software provides two primary interfaces: an HTTP REST API and a gRPC service. These interfaces allow developers to interact with the lnd node and utilize its functionalities. However, it's important to note that these APIs are not yet stable and may undergo significant changes in the near future.\n\nFor more detailed information about the lnd APIs, there is a documentation website available at api.lightning.community. This website provides an automatically generated set of documentation for the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs. Additionally, developers can find a variety of resources, such as guides, articles, example applications, and community resources, at docs.lightning.engineering.\n\nThere is also an active Slack community where developers, testers, and users of lnd gather to discuss various aspects of the software and the Lightning Network in general. This community serves as a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\nIf you want to build the lnd software from its source code, there are installation instructions available. Alternatively, if you prefer to run lnd using Docker, there are specific instructions for that as well.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that when operating an lnd node on the main Bitcoin network (mainnet), it is crucial to follow the operational safety guidelines provided by the lnd team. These guidelines ensure the safe operation of the software and help prevent the loss of funds.\n\nThe developers of lnd prioritize security and encourage the responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities or privacy issues. There is an email address provided (security at lightning dot engineering) for reporting such issues, and the developers have a designated PGP key for encrypted communications.\n\nLastly, the mention of adding a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key for \"hieblmi\" in the script indicates a technical change related to the project's codebase. This change is likely not directly relevant to most users and can be skipped unless you are specifically interested in the technical details of the implementation.",

      "summaryeli15": "In this pull request (PR), there are several changes being made. Let's go through them in detail.\n\n1. Refactoring the musig2 session logic: The first change being made is a small refactoring to extract the musig2 session logic into a new package and struct. This allows the musig2 session logic to be reused later in tests without creating the entire wallet system.\n\n2. Preparing the chanfunding package: The second change is to prepare the chanfunding package for the new musig2 channels. This is done by updating the set of intents and assemblers to recognize musig2. A new boolean variable, `musig2`, is used to determine if the new taproot funding scripts need to be used.\n\n3. Generating nonces for the local session: The next change is related to generating nonces for the local session. A counter-based system is used to generate the nonces that are sent to the remote party. The underlying counter used for the system is the commitment height. This commitment height is then used by the existing shachain producer to generate fresh and deterministic randomness. This approach eliminates the need to store the secret nonce to disk. Instead, the nonce can be regenerated using the commitment height and combined with the signature stored on disk to create the final witness that is broadcasted.\n\n4. Implementation of the funding logic within the wallet: The next PR in this series will use the changes made in this PR to implement the funding logic within the wallet itself, specifically in the reservations module.\n\nAdditionally, there are comments and reviews being made throughout the PR, suggesting improvements and addressing potential issues. For example, one reviewer suggests enforcing a check to ensure that the nonce is not repeated, to which the developer responds by explaining the design choices made regarding nonces and suggesting a better area to add additional protections. Another reviewer points out duplicate code and suggests using a multimutex to avoid relying on a single mutex for the entire musig session set.\n\nOnce all the reviews and comments are addressed, the PR can be merged.",

      "summary": "In this PR (Pull Request), there have been several commits made to integrate new taproot channels into an existing internal funding flow. The PR also includes some refactoring to unify the processes of signing and verifying incoming commitment transaction signatures.\n\nOne of the changes made in this PR is the use of an existing functional option type to derive the local nonce. The nonce is based on the initial shachain pre-image that will be used as the revocation. This nonce is sent in the `open_channel` message by the funder and can be used to generate the final signature when receiving the `funding_signed.nonce` from the fundee.\n\nThe PR also includes the integration of the new funding flow with the existing internal wallet integration tests. This ensures that the new functionality is properly tested and validated.\n\nThe last ~14 commits in this PR are new, and along the way, some rebase issues were found and fixed in commits marked as [temp]. These commits are likely related to resolving conflicts or addressing issues that arose during the development process.\n\nThe next PR in this series will focus on modifying the channel state machine to understand the new commitment dance. This suggests that there are further updates and enhancements planned for the taproot channels.\n\nThe PR also mentions that there is documentation available to see all the available qualifiers related to this project. If you have any questions about this project, it is recommended to sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to contact the maintainers and the community.\n\nOverall, this PR introduces new taproot channels into the existing internal funding flow, makes some improvements to signing and verifying commitments, and integrates the new functionality with existing tests.",
      "summaryeli15": "This pull request (PR) contains several commits that introduce new features and improvements to the existing codebase. The PR primarily focuses on integrating taproot channels into the internal funding flow of the project.\n\nThe first commit adds a new channel type to the wallet and includes the necessary fields to handle contribution messages from both parties involved in the channel. The new fields include a local nonce and an internal musig session.\n\nThe second commit updates the resolutions, which are used to recreate the set of scripts. These changes are made in preparation for the upcoming integration of taproot channels.\n\nThe third commit builds upon the previous commits and integrates the taproot channels into the existing funding flow. Along the way, some refactoring is done to unify processes such as signing and verifying incoming commitment transaction signatures. The local nonce is derived using an existing functional option type, which is based on the initial shachain pre-image used as revocation.\n\nThe fourth commit modifies the starting logic by removing an attempt to add a tower client for taproot channels. Instead, a log message is added to indicate that this feature is not yet available.\n\nThese changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the project and introduce new functionality. The PR also includes modifications to address issues found during the review process.\n\nIf you have any questions about this project or need further clarification, you can sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue or reach out to its maintainers and the community.

      "summary": "In this comment, the author is discussing a pull request (PR) on GitHub related to a project. The PR is addressing an issue (#7297) and proposing a possible solution. The author mentions that they read every piece of feedback and take input from users seriously.\n\nThe author suggests that to see all available qualifiers, one should refer to the project's documentation. They also mention that if someone has a question about the project, they can sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and get in touch with the maintainers and the community.\n\nThe author further explains that the PR is being opened in draft mode to demonstrate the scope of a potential solution for issue #7297. They mention that the PR showcases a workaround for persisting TLV (Type-Length-Value) data that is transmitted in \"update_add_hltc\".\n\nThe workaround involves encoding the TLVs (used to save extra data) and setting \"channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData\" to store this encoded data. The author points out that the last commit in the PR provides an example of where this setting needs to be done.\n\nThe author explains that the reason for opening the PR in draft mode is to describe the comment to others. They invite others to learn more about the reason behind the PR.\n\nThe author expresses happiness that the approach they suggested is being considered. They acknowledge that it may not be the ideal solution but believe it gets the job done and helps avoid migrations in that area. However, before proceeding, the author suggests manually reviewing other areas to ensure there are no other instances where an exact length is used instead of being serialized as var bytes.\n\nAdditionally, the author suggests posting about these other areas separately. They ask for opinions on whether the PR should be merged as-is or combined with a larger preparatory route blinding PR. The author mentions they lean towards the former approach to keep the DB workaround PRs more isolated but are open to either option.\n\nThe author provides some technical details about the serialization and deserialization processes, mentioning functions like \"decodePayload\" and how HTLCs are stored as var bytes in ChannelCommitment and re-loaded into memory.\n\nThe author also responds to a specific question about a test case, explaining the change in handling \"OnionBlob\" and why it was previously allowed to have a size less than 1366 in tests.\n\nFinally, there are some comments praising the changes made in the PR, stating that they are clear and concise.",
      "summaryeli15": "In the context of this project, the team has been receiving feedback and taking it very seriously. They have made a workaround to solve an issue related to persisting TLV (Type-Length-Value) data transmitted in the update_add_hltc function. In order to save extra data provided in the PaymentDescriptor, the team encodes the TLVs (which are a way to structure data) and sets the channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData field.\n\nThe team has opened this pull request as a draft to show what could be done to address issue #7297. The purpose of this pull request is to demonstrate a possible solution. The team acknowledges that this may not be the best approach, but it gets the job done and also avoids the need for migrations in this area. They want to make sure there are no other areas where an exact length is used instead of serialized as variable bytes before proceeding further.\n\nThe team is happy to see that you have come around to this approach and thinks it is the better option compared to other alternatives. They suggest doing a manual review to check for any other areas where an exact length is used. They are open to either merging this pull request as-is or combining it with a larger preparatory route blinding pull request.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the TLVs are serialized and deserialized using updated functions, and they are always stored as variable bytes. The decodePayload function reads the fixed size blob of the HTLC, and these HTLCs are serialized and deserialized during commitSet. Legacy nodes use LogChainActions/FetchChainActions, which also serialize and deserialize using variable bytes. HTLCs are stored as variable bytes in ChannelCommitment and reloaded into memory.\n\nThe team loves how small and focused this pull request is and appreciates the workaround to address the 1366 byte restriction of the onion packet encoding. They have left some comments and believe that the pull request is almost ready to go.\n\nThere is a question about where a specific test case came from, as it seems onion blobs were always 1366 bytes in size even before this change. The team clarifies that previously, an OnionBlob was just a byte slice, so its size could be less than 1366. However, they would never be less than that as reading them would not be possible. The unit tests could use junk data to simulate different cases.\n\nThe latest push only addresses minor issues and adds some comments, without any changes to the functionality.\n\nOverall, the changes made in this pull request are seen as awesome, clear, and concise.",

      "summary": "In this commit, several changes are made to improve the functionality and usability of the software. \n\nFirstly, a new function called `DefaultWtclientCfg` is added. This function is responsible for populating default values for the `Wtclient` config struct. The `Wtclient` struct is an important component of the software that deals with watchtower client configurations. By setting default values for this struct, the software can provide sensible defaults to the users.\n\nSimilarly, another function called `DefaultWatchtowerConfig` is added in this commit. This function constructs a default `lncfg.Watchtower` struct, which is used to store watchtower configuration details. By having a default watchtower config, the software can provide initial values to the users and reduce the burden of manually configuring the watchtower.\n\nFurthermore, this commit also makes a significant change by removing the `PrivateTowerURIs` member from the `Wtclient` config struct. This field has been deprecated since version 0.8.0-beta of the software. The deprecation means that this field is no longer supported and specifying it would cause LND (the software) to fail during startup. Hence, it is crucial to remove deprecated features and inform the users about the removal to avoid any issues.\n\nFinally, the commit mentions that merging this particular pull request may also address some existing issues. This indicates that the changes made in the commit are aimed at resolving those issues, further highlighting the importance of this commit in improving the software.",

This function is responsible for populating default values for the `WtClient` struct, which is a configuration object used in the code. The purpose of this function is to provide default values for the wtclient (watchtower client) configuration.\n\nSimilarly, another function called `DefaultWatchtowerCfg` is added in this commit. This function constructs a default configuration struct called `Watchtower` in the `lncfg` package. This configuration struct is used to configure the behavior and settings of the watchtower service. The `DefaultWatchtowerCfg` function sets up default values for this configuration struct.\n\nBoth of these functions play a crucial role in populating default values for the wtclient and watchtower configurations in the main LND (Lightning Network Daemon) configuration struct. The main LND configuration struct is used to define various settings for running LND. When a user runs the `lnd --help` command, it displays the available options and their default values. These default values are now being populated using the `DefaultWtClientCfg` and `DefaultWatchtowerCfg` functions.\n\nIn addition to adding these functions, this PR also removes a deprecated member called `PrivateTowerURIs` from the `WtClient` config struct. The `PrivateTowerURIs` field has been marked as deprecated since v0.8.0-beta, indicating that it is no longer recommended for use. If a user specifies this field in their configuration, LND would fail to start.

Here's a breakdown of each part:\n\n1. \"We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously\": This means that the people responsible for handling the BIPs review and consider every feedback they receive from the community.\n\n2. \"To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation\": Refers to additional information or details that can be found in the documentation provided by the BIP system. These qualifiers might include specific guidelines or criteria for submitting proposals.\n\n3. \"Work fast with our official CLI. Learn more about the CLI\": This suggests that there is a command-line interface (CLI) available for working quickly with the BIP system. The CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with the BIP system more efficiently.\n\n4. \"If nothing happens, download GitHub Desktop and try again\": This is a troubleshooting recommendation. If the previous step doesn't work or encounter difficulties, the suggestion is to download GitHub Desktop, a desktop application for managing GitHub repositories, and try again.\n\n5. \"There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again\": This message indicates that there was an issue while setting up the environment to work with the BIP system's codespace. The recommendation is to try again, possibly using the suggested GitHub Desktop.\n\n6. \"People wishing to submit BIPs...\": This is a guideline for individuals who want to propose their ideas or documents to the bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org mailing list. It advises that the proposal should be shared with the mailing list before assigning it a BIP number. BIP 2 is referenced for the full process details.\n\n7. \"After discussion, please open a PR\": PR stands for Pull Request, a term commonly used in the context of GitHub. It suggests that after discussing the proposal with the community on the mailing list, the next step would be to create a Pull Request on the BIP repository.\n\n8. \"After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here\": Once the proposal goes through the review process, including copy-editing and community acceptance, it will be published in the BIP repository.\n\n9. \"We are fairly liberal with approving BIPs...\": This sentence expresses the general approach of the BIP system towards approving proposals. They are open to accepting a wide range of BIPs and try to avoid excessive involvement in decision-making on behalf of the community.\n\n10. \"The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution...\": In exceptional situations where there is a dispute and no consensus can be reached regarding a decision, the conservative option will be preferred. This is to ensure stability and prevent contentious situations from negatively impacting the community.\n\n11. \"Having a BIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active\": Merely having a BIP listed in the repository doesn't automatically make it an accepted standard. A proposal's status must change to \"Final\" or \"Active\" to become a formally accepted standard.\n\n12. \"Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin users (see also: economic majority)\": This statement advises individuals proposing changes to recognize that the final decision or consent for those changes lies with the consensus of the Bitcoin users. The \"economic majority\" is mentioned as an additional related concept.\n\nLastly, the request for \"clearer, more failure details, + use OP_TRUE\" seems unrelated to the initial statement and requires further context to provide an explanation.",

The provided mailing list address is specifically for Bitcoin development discussions and ideas. It is important to note that while submitting, one should not assign a number to their proposal, and reading BIP 2 (another document that describes the complete process) is recommended.\n\n7. \"After discussion, please open a PR.\"\nAfter sharing the proposal with the mailing list and engaging in discussions, the next step is to create a Pull Request (PR). A PR is a way to propose changes or additions to a project on the GitHub platform.\n\n8. \"After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.\"\nOnce the PR is created, the proposal goes through the processes of copy-editing (reviewing and making necessary edits) and acceptance (approval). If accepted, the proposal will be published in the designated place, possibly referring to the project's official website or related repository.\n\n9. \"We are fairly liberal with approving BIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community.\"\nThis states that the project is generally open-minded when it comes to approving Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. The community's opinions and decisions hold significant value, and the maintainers or authors of the project try to avoid excessive involvement in decision-making processes.\n\n10. \"The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.\"\nWhile the project aims to be inclusive and open to community decisions, there are exceptional cases where disputes arise, and a consensus cannot be reached among the involved parties. In such situations, a conservative approach, which favors the safer or more cautious option, will be preferred.\n\n11. \"Having a BIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.\"\nThis highlights that simply having a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal present in the mentioned context does not automatically make it a formally accepted standard. The proposal needs to gain the status of either \"Final\" or \"Active\" to be considered a formally accepted standard.\n\n12. \"Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin users (see also: economic majority).\"\nThis advises individuals who are suggesting changes or improvements to the Bitcoin protocol to keep in mind that the ultimate decision or consent may rely on the consensus of the Bitcoin users.

      "summary": "This text provides information about Blockstream Greenlight, a self-sovereign Lightning node in the cloud. Here is a detailed explanation of the key points mentioned in the text:\n\n1. Feedback: The provider of Blockstream Greenlight values user feedback and takes it seriously into consideration.\n\n2. Qualifiers: The available qualifiers for Blockstream Greenlight can be found in their documentation. These qualifiers are likely options or features that can be customized or configured.\n\n3. CLI: Blockstream Greenlight offers an official CLI (command-line interface) tool that allows users to work quickly and efficiently. The CLI is a software program that enables users to interact with the Blockstream Greenlight infrastructure from a command line.\n\n4. GitHub Desktop: In case there is an issue with the Blockstream Greenlight CLI, users can download GitHub Desktop, a graphical user interface for GitHub, and try again. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts code repositories and version control systems.\n\n5. Repository: The text mentions that the repository contains all the necessary files and resources to get started with Blockstream Greenlight. This repository likely hosts the code, configuration files, and documentation for Blockstream Greenlight.\n\n6. gRPC Services: Blockstream Greenlight exposes a number of services over gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) protocol. These services allow applications to integrate and users to manage and control their node running on the Blockstream Greenlight infrastructure.\n\n7. Protocol Buffers: The protocol buffers files are provided, which are a language-agnostic way of serializing structured data. This allows for easier integration with different programming languages.\n\n8. Roles: An application can implement one or both of the roles provided by Blockstream Greenlight. Particular care needs to be taken when implementing the key manager role, as only one application can implement this role at a time.\n\n9. Walkthrough: The text provides a quick walkthrough using the python glcli command line tool to help users get started with Blockstream Greenlight.\n\n10. Prebuilt Packages: There are prebuilt packages available for the glcli and the gl-client-py libraries. These packages allow developers to quickly start using Blockstream Greenlight without having to compile the binary extensions themselves.\n\n11. Installation Issues: If there are any problems with the installation, it could be due to the absence of a prebuilt version of the gl-client-py library. Users are advised to refer to the library's documentation on how to build it from source. Additionally, users are encouraged to inform the Blockstream Greenlight team about the platform they are using, so it can be added to their build system if possible.\n\n12. Registration and Recovery: The registration and recovery processes in Blockstream Greenlight are managed by the scheduler. The scheduler prefix is used in the commands related to these processes.\n\n13. Certificates and Keys: During the registration process, an mTLS (mutual Transport Layer Security) certificate and a matching private key are provided. These are used to authenticate and authorize the application with the services. They should be stored securely on the device and used for all future communication. The key manager's signature is required for registering as a new user.\n\n14. Recovery Process: The recovery process also involves the key manager providing a signature. This process provides a certificate and a matching private key that can be used for authentication and authorization.\n\n15. Direct Access: Once registered or recovered, the node can be reached directly at the provided URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).\n\n16. Attaching the hsmd: To attach the hsmd (hardware security module daemon) to the node, a specific command needs to be run.\n\n17. Managing the Node: Once the node is set up, it can be managed just like a local node. This includes tasks such as sending and receiving on-chain transactions, sending and receiving off-chain transactions, opening and closing channels, etc.\n\n18. Language Bindings: Blockstream Greenlight provides language bindings for easier integration with different programming languages. These bindings expect a securely generated secret, which is used to derive private keys and other secrets.\n\n19. Seed Generation: The secret used for language bindings should be generated according to the BIP 39 standard. It should be kept safe on the user's device and should not be stored on the application server. The mnemonic generated during the seed creation can be used to initialize other client applications with the same secret.\n\n20. Supported Networks: Blockstream Greenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest. Testnet is recommended for testing purposes, but regtest and signet will be added in the future. Users should keep in mind that the testnet can be unstable, and the lightning network running on testnet might not be well-maintained.\n\n21. Environment Details: Currently, there is a single cluster in the us-west2 region that hosts the Blockstream Greenlight scheduler and nodes. The provider plans to implement geo-load-balancing to reduce roundtrip times from other regions worldwide.\n\n22. mTLS Handshake: The mTLS handshake involves multiple roundtrips, but it can be optimized by caching certain parts of the handshake. Keeping the gRPC connections open and reusing them whenever possible helps minimize the overhead of the mTLS handshake.\n\nThe text also provides some example commands using the glcli tool, which demonstrate how to register, recover, schedule, and manage a Blockstream Greenlight node. Additional commands include handling the hsmd, getting information about the node, and performing various operations such as closing, connecting, destroying, and funding channels.",
      "summaryeli15": "Blockstream Greenlight is a service that allows you to run your own Lightning node in the cloud. It provides a number of services that you can integrate into your applications and allows you to manage and control your node on their infrastructure.\n\nTo get started with Blockstream Greenlight, you can use the python glcli command line tool. There are prebuilt packages available for this tool, so you don't need to compile anything yourself. However, if you encounter any issues during the installation, it may be because there is no prebuilt version of the gl-client-py library for your platform. In that case, you can refer to the library's documentation on how to build it from source, and let the Blockstream team know so they can add support for your platform in their build system.\n\nThe registration and recovery processes are managed by the scheduler. When you register as a new user, the scheduler provides you with an mTLS certificate and private key that you need to store on your device. These credentials are used to authenticate and authorize your application with the services provided by Blockstream Greenlight. When recovering your account, the key manager provides a signature to verify your identity.\n\nOnce you have the necessary credentials, you can use the glcli command line tool to interact with your Blockstream Greenlight node. You can schedule the node, attach the Hardware Security Module Daemon (hsmd) to the node, and manage various aspects of the node such as sending and receiving transactions, opening and closing channels, etc. The glcli tool uses protocol buffers for encoding binary values and communicates with the node over gRPC.\n\nWhen using the language bindings provided by Blockstream Greenlight, you need to generate a 32-byte securely generated secret. This secret is used to generate all private keys and secrets for your node. It is important to keep this secret safe on your device and not store it on the application server, as it controls your funds. The secret should be generated according to the BIP 39 standard to ensure portability and compatibility with other client applications.\n\nBlockstream Greenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest. It is suggested to use testnet for testing purposes. Blockstream plans to open up the regtest network and add signet in the future to make testing even simpler. Keep in mind that the testnet can sometimes be unstable, and the lightning network on testnet may not be as well-maintained as the bitcoin network.\n\nCurrently, Blockstream Greenlight has a single cluster in the us-west2 region. The scheduler and nodes are located in this region. Blockstream plans to implement geo-load-balancing of the nodes and associated databases to reduce roundtrip times from other parts of the world. This will improve the performance of the network.\n\nTo minimize the overhead of the mTLS handshake, it is recommended to keep the gRPC connections open and reuse them whenever possible.\n\nTo install the glcli tool, you can use the pip package manager. Here is the command to install the tool:\n\n```\npip install -U gl-client\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can install the gl-client-py package from the private repository hosted by Blockstream using the following command:\n\n```\npip install --extra-index-url=https://us-west2-python.pkg.dev/c-lightning/greenlight-pypi/simple/ -U glcli\n```\n\nOnce the tool is installed, you can use various commands with the glcli tool to interact with your Blockstream Greenlight node. For example, you can register and recover your account, schedule the node, get information about the node, run the hsmd, create invoices, list funds and peers, make payments, stop the scheduler, and withdraw funds.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the Blockstream Greenlight service and how to get started with it.",

The bot has been gaining popularity, especially in Latin America where people are turning to Bitcoin due to economic and political issues in their countries.\n\nHowever, there is concern that Telegram, being a centralized platform, may be susceptible to censorship or government intervention. To address this issue, the author proposes the development of a platform called Nostr where a censorship-resistant and non-custodial Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange can operate without a single point of failure.\n\nThe proposed platform, called Mostro, would facilitate peer-to-peer communication on top of Nostr. It would act as an escrow service, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of Bitcoin transactions between buyers and sellers. To achieve this, Mostro would utilize a Lightning Network node to create hold invoices for sellers and regular invoices for buyers.\n\nTo create, sign, and send events through the Nostr network, Mostro would require a private key. The author emphasizes that Mostro should be easy to use and reliable, encouraging users to create their own Mostro nodes. Running a Mostro node would involve setting up a Lightning Network node with sufficient liquidity, ensuring 99.9% uptime, and handling resources. Sellers would pay fees for each successful order, which would contribute to maintaining the network.\n\nTo compile and run Mostro, the author provides instructions for Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, including installing cargo and running specific commands. Necessary configuration settings for connecting with a Lightning Network daemon (lnd) node, such as the macaroon file path, IP address, and port, need to be set in the settings.dev.toml file.\n\nThe data for Mostro is stored in a SQLite database file (mostro.db), but the file name and path can be changed by editing the relevant settings. Before building Mostro, the database needs to be initialized using sqlx_cli. The private key for the Mostro node needs to be set in the nsec_privkey variable.\n\nAdditionally, the passage briefly mentions setting up a private dockerized relay for Mostro, which involves spinning up a docker container with an instance of Nostr-rs-relay that listens on port 7000.\n\nThe passage also includes a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the seller, Mostro, and the Lightning Network node during a Bitcoin transaction. The seller requests a hold invoice from Mostro, pays it through the Lightning Network, and receives confirmation of payment. Finally, the seller can communicate with the buyer to proceed with the transaction.\n\nOverall, the passage outlines the concept and implementation details of a decentralized and censorship-resistant Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange platform called Mostro, which aims to provide a secure and reliable environment for buying and selling Bitcoin without compromising user privacy.",

However, there is concern that Telegram may become subject to censorship or government intervention.\n\nTo address this concern, a platform called Nostr is introduced. Nostr is seen as a censorship-resistant and non-custodial platform where the project can exist without the risk of being censored by a powerful entity. Mostro, a peer-to-peer exchange platform, is being built on top of Nostr.\n\nMostro acts as an escrow service that facilitates the buying and selling of Bitcoin between users. It utilizes the Lightning Network node to create and handle invoices for sellers and pay the buyers using Lightning regular invoices. Mostro requires a private key to create, sign, and send events through the Nostr network.\n\nIn order for users to buy and sell Bitcoin using Mostro, they need to have Mostro's clients and a Lightning Wallet. Initially, a web client is being built, with plans to develop mobile and desktop clients in the future. The goal is to make it easy for people to operate as Mostro nodes, ensuring reliability and availability for users. Users will be able to rate and provide feedback on Mostros, creating competition among them.\n\nTo compile the Mostro project on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, you need to install cargo and run specific commands. The repository needs to be cloned, and a new settings.dev.toml file needs to be created based on the settings.toml file. The Lightning Network node connection settings need to be configured in the settings.dev.toml file. The project uses a SQLite database file named mostro.db by default.\n\nBefore building, the database needs to be initialized using sqlx_cli. Once the setup is complete, the project can be run.\n\nThe passage also mentions the option to use a private Dockerized relay. By running specific commands, a Docker container with an instance of nostr-rs-relay will be created, listening at port 7000. This relay allows communication with the Nostr platform.\n\nFinally, a diagram is shown, summarizing the interaction between the seller, Mostro, and the Lightning Network node. The seller requests a hold invoice from Mostro, pays through the Lightning Network, and receives confirmation of payment. This allows the seller to proceed with the transaction.\n\nTo conclude, the passage explains the concept of a Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange platform called Mostro, built on Nostr, which aims to provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial way for people to buy and sell Bitcoin without giving up personal data. The project encourages the creation of reliable and accessible Mostro nodes, and provides instructions on how to compile and run the project.",

      "summary": "Munstr is a software that combines the functionalities of MuSig and Nostr to create a secure and encrypted method of handling and signing bitcoin transactions. It uses Schnorr signature based MuSig keys, which are a type of multisignature keys. The software operates in a terminal-based wallet, and it uses Nostr networks as a decentralized communication layer.\n\nThe purpose of Munstr is to enable the secure transportation and digital signing of bitcoin transactions in a way that makes it difficult for chain analysis to identify the nature and setup of the transaction data. This is achieved by making Munstr transactions appear as single key Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) spends when observed on the blockchain.\n\nMunstr relies on an interactive, multisignature (n-of-n) Bitcoin wallet to coordinate a signing session for taproot-based outputs. These outputs are associated with an aggregated public key.\n\nIt's important to note that Munstr is currently in beta and should not be used with real funds. The code and authors may change, and the maintainers do not take responsibility for any lost funds or damages.\n\nSome key features of Munstr include:\n\n1. Open source: The software is open source, meaning anyone can use it or contribute to its development.\n\n2. Multisignature keysets: Munstr uses multisignature keysets to reduce the risk that comes with relying on a single key.\n\n3. Encrypted communications: Munstr utilizes Nostr decentralized events for encrypted communications. This ensures that the PSBT data (partially signed bitcoin transaction) is securely transported.\n\nThe process of using Munstr involves the following steps:\n\n1. The signer utilizes private keys from a multisignature keyset to digitally sign a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT).\n\n2. The PSBT data is transported and communicated through the Nostr decentralized network.\n\n3. Coordinators act as mediators between digital signers and wallets. They facilitate the collection of digital signatures from all required key signers (n-of-n) and assist in broadcasting the fully signed transaction.\n\nIn addition to the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, Munstr also uses other libraries and resources.\n\nThe software is licensed under the MIT License, and it is copyrighted by TeamMunstr. To set up the coordinator component of Munstr, the user is instructed to execute the command \"cp src/coordinator/db.template.json src/coordinator/db.json\" followed by \"./start_coordinator.py\".\n\nIt's worth noting that this explanation is based on the provided text and may not cover all aspects of Munstr in great detail.",

      "summary": "In this explanation, we are focusing on the Proof of Liabilities (PoL) aspect of the problem, assuming that the Proof of Reserves (PoR) part has already been solved using conventional on-chain attestation methods.\n\nThe scenario described involves Carol, who wants to withdraw funds from her Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment to someone else using electronic cash (ecash). To do this, Carol sends the ecash to the mint and asks the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value. The mint then burns the ecash, meaning it is destroyed, and pays the invoice.\n\nOne important thing to note is that ecash tokens are burned at every transaction and at any payout onto Lightning. This means that the lifetime of an ecash token is relatively short. It also means that the list of issued signatures (mint proofs) and the list of burned tokens (burn proofs) can grow quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly. To solve this problem, a key rotation mechanism is introduced.\n\nKey rotation involves periodically changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint. By doing this, the mint can create a record, called a PoL report, which includes all the mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and burn proofs (redeemed secrets) for a specific period (epoch). This report is publicly released.\n\nThe purpose of the PoL report is to compare the mint's outstanding ecash balance (liabilities) to its on-chain assets (reserves). A cheating mint would try to artificially reduce its liabilities by manipulating the list of mint proofs and inflating the list of burn proofs. However, it cannot artificially inflate its on-chain assets.\n\nUsers can verify the PoL reports to check if the mint has manipulated it. They can also verify whether their blind signatures are included in the report. Additionally, they can check if their ecash from a previous epoch is worth more than the outstanding balance of that epoch.\n\nIf a user finds that their blind signature is not listed in the PoL reports, they can call out the mint. To prove that they have a valid signature from the mint, the user provides a form of proof called a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof. This allows others to verify that the signature is indeed from the mint. However, revealing this proof removes the privacy of the contesting user.\n\nAnother way a mint could lie about its PoL report is by including fake burn proofs in its list of spent secrets. This means the mint could spend unbacked ecash, report it in the burn proof list, and artificially increase the amount of redeemed ecash while reducing the outstanding balance reported.\n\nTo prevent such manipulations, the keys used by the mint are rotated on an agreed-upon schedule. This rotation is publicly committed to, ensuring that no additional fake mint proofs are added to past PoL reports. Users can validate the mint proof lists and detect if new entries are added or legitimate ones are removed. User wallets also adopt a policy of refusing tokens from epochs other than the most recent one.\n\nOverall, rotating the keys introduces an \"arrow of time\" into the token dynamics. User wallets refuse to accept tokens from an older keyset, forcing all tokens from past epochs to move into the newest keyset. This periodic \"bank run\" allows users to observe past epochs and determine if the mint has manipulated the reports.\n\nIn this PoL scheme, a cheating mint can only artificially inflate its liabilities but not reduce them without a higher risk of being caught. If the mint inflates its liabilities, the guardians of the reserves will request a withdrawal to maintain a constant percentage of reserves. If the mint shrinks its liabilities, it risks being caught by its users.\n\nOverall, this PoL scheme helps create a trust model for ecash systems. The majority of a mint's funds are held in a multisig (multiple signature) address controlled by multiple independent parties, while the ecash mint itself is operated by a single-sig (single signature) entity that optimizes its operation for efficient payments.\n\nWhile this scheme offers significant improvements in the auditability of ecash systems, there are still some unresolved problems that are not addressed in this proposal. However, the authors encourage readers to reach out with any issues or improvements they may have identified.",

      "summary": "LDK Node is a Lightning node library that is built using LDK and BDK. It provides developers with an easy way to set up a self-custodial Lightning node. The library has a straightforward interface and includes an integrated on-chain wallet.\n\nLDK Node is designed to simplify the process of setting up a Lightning node. It provides sane defaults for most configurations, but to effectively set up the interconnected modules, users need to have a deeper understanding of the underlying protocol and some familiarity with the LDK API. Additionally, LDK Node is wallet-agnostic, which means it doesn't come with an included on-chain wallet. Users need to integrate it with a suitable on-chain wallet themselves.\n\nAlthough getting started with LDK can require some effort, LDK Node was created to be a more fully-baked solution. It aims to hide the complexities of the protocol without sacrificing usability. Compared to LDK, which has over 900 exposed methods, LDK Node's API is much smaller, with only around 30 API calls. The core principles of LDK Node are simplicity and minimalism, but it remains configurable enough to operate a fully functional self-custodial Lightning node in various use cases.\n\nWhen designing an API for handling protocol complexity, there is a trade-off between simplicity and expressiveness. Increasing the configurability and interconnectivity of components can make the API more complicated. Users then need to spend more time learning and scrutinizing the API before they can effectively use it. The LDK API leans towards expressiveness, while LDK Node prioritizes simplicity.\n\nThe first release of LDK Node includes a set of opinionated design choices and ready-to-use modules. Its main goal is to enable fast, private, and secure Bitcoin transactions for end-users. Currently, most Lightning deployments are custodial services that can only be queried by the client devices of the end-users. Deploying self-custodial Lightning nodes on end-user devices can be complex and prone to pitfalls. LDK Node aims to simplify the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes, with a focus on mobile applications. The initial release includes features specifically designed for mobile deployments, such as integration with an Esplora chain data source and a Rapid Gossip Sync server, which accommodate limited bandwidth and traffic quota in mobile environments.\n\nLDK Node is primarily written in Rust and can be added as a library dependency to any std Rust program. In addition to its Rust API, it also offers language bindings for Swift, Kotlin, and Python based on UniFFI. Flutter bindings are also available to use LDK Node library in mobile environments.\n\nThe main abstraction in the library is the Node object, which can be retrieved by setting up and configuring a Builder object according to your preferences and calling one of the build methods. The Node object allows you to control the Lightning node by executing commands such as start, stop, connect_open_channel, send_payment, and more.\n\nThe code snippet provided demonstrates a basic usage example of LDK Node, including setting the network, configuring the Esplora server and Rapid Gossip Sync server, starting the node, funding an address, connecting to another node and opening a channel, waiting for events, sending a payment using an invoice, and stopping the node.",

LDK Node is designed to be wallet-agnostic, meaning it doesn't come with its own on-chain wallet. Users need to integrate it with a suitable on-chain wallet on their own.\n\nTo make it easier for developers to get started, LDK Node offers a more fully-baked solution compared to using LDK directly. It hides some of the protocol complexities and provides a smaller API surface, which means developers have fewer methods to interact with.\n\nLDK Node focuses on simplicity and minimalism while still allowing for configuration options to meet different use cases.

      "summary": "BTC Warp is a project that aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes with the Bitcoin network. Currently, it can take several days for new nodes and users to sync a full Bitcoin node due to the large amount of data to download and verify. This process is time-consuming and requires significant hardware and network resources. BTC Warp proposes a solution using zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to provide a verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers.\n\nLight nodes play a crucial role in the Bitcoin ecosystem as they allow participants to connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without storing the full chain history or participating in consensus. However, light nodes still require storage capacity to store block headers, which can be challenging for some users. BTC Warp aims to reduce the storage requirement for light nodes by leveraging the succinctness property of zkSNARKs.\n\nBy using BTC Warp, new light clients can instantly verify the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain using significantly less storage, around 30 kB, compared to the 60 MB required by traditional light nodes. The ultimate goal of BTC Warp is to be able to SNARK (generate a succinct proof) the full Bitcoin blockchain for full nodes, with light nodes being the first step in the process.\n\nThere are three types of Bitcoin nodes: full nodes, which store and validate the entire blockchain; light nodes, which interact with the network without storing the full chain history; and mining nodes, which participate in the consensus and mining process.\n\nBTC Warp uses zkSNARKs to generate a proof of validity for a certain header with a specific amount of work. This proof allows light clients to sync to the Bitcoin network in constant time without downloading and verifying the proof-of-work for each header. The proof verification algorithm checks if a given set of headers form a valid chain and increments the total work based on the work in each header.\n\nOne challenge in implementing BTC Warp is the size of the Bitcoin chain. The theoretical maximum number of SHAs (secure hash algorithms) that can fit in a circuit is around 10,000 due to limitations of the proving systems like Groth16. Since Bitcoin has over 780,000 blocks, this would lead to approximately 1.5 million SHAs. To address this challenge, recursive SNARKs are used to parallelize proof generation, improve scalability, computational efficiency, and reduce centralization. Polygon's Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system is utilized due to its faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nRecursive SNARKs allow for the composition of proofs in a \"proof tree\" structure, where each layer of the tree has a different circuit. However, implementing recursive SNARKs is complex and requires careful consideration of extensibility. The proof tree in BTC Warp verifies block headers at the leaf layer, and each non-leaf layer combines information from its children nodes. Parallelization is achieved by allowing each layer to prove a sequence of headers, with each layer's circuit proving the start hash, end hash, and total work for the sequence.\n\nGenerating proofs with zkSNARKs is computationally expensive. To optimize proof generation time, computation is parallelized by coordinating a tree of proofs. The current proof generation time takes about $5000, but optimization can reduce it to approximately $1000 for a one-time sync and even less for proof updates for new blocks.\n\nBTC Warp aims to support new Bitcoin block headers, not just existing ones, to enable syncing of light clients in the future using a succinct proof instead of resyncing. The composable tree approach is chosen for the proof generation process, which makes it faster and cheaper by leveraging parallelization while ensuring proofs for future blocks.\n\nTo obtain Bitcoin block headers, the Nakamoto light client, written in Rust, is used. Nakamoto listens to network gossip to update the proof for new blocks. An API is created around Nakamoto to serve block headers and facilitate the proof generation step.\n\nThe generation of new block proofs involves setting up a listener to detect new blocks. When new blocks are detected, a Fargate instance (an AWS container service) is spawned to update the proof tree. Optimizations and benchmarking are performed to determine the most cost and time-effective way to generate the proofs.\n\nThere are further areas of improvement that can enhance the BTC Warp project. One approach is to focus on optimizing circuit serialization to reduce the time taken by the prover during proof generation. Additionally, exploring technologies like Utreexo, which leverages efficient data structures, can help further reduce storage requirements.\n\nThe main challenge faced in BTC Warp is the size of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) in a block. The UTXOs in the full Bitcoin chain can take over 200GB of storage. To address this, incorporating Utreexo and other efficient data structures within a zkSNARK can potentially enable full block and transaction verification.\n\nBTC Warp has potential use cases beyond light client syncing. Some examples mentioned are instant settlement of off-chain transactions, trustless proof of existence, and verifiable audit trails. BTC Warp welcomes other use case ideas and is actively recruiting developers and seeking partnerships with blockchain ecosystems and applications interested in utilizing its underlying primitives.\n\nIn summary, BTC Warp is a project that aims to solve the light node syncing problem in Bitcoin by using zkSNARKs for verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers. It reduces storage requirements for light nodes and explores recursive SNARKs for parallelized proof generation. BTC Warp envisions SNARKing the full Bitcoin blockchain for full nodes and opens up opportunities for various use cases.",
      "summaryeli15": "This passage explains the BTC Warp project, which aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network. Currently, new nodes and users can take several days to sync a full Bitcoin node due to the large number of blocks and transactions. This is time-consuming and requires significant computing power and network resources. The BTC Warp project proposes a solution using zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge), which are a type of cryptographic proof.\n\nThe goal of BTC Warp is to allow new light clients to instantly verify the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain using significantly less storage. The idea is to use zkSNARKs to generate a succinct proof of the Bitcoin block headers, which can be used to verify the validity of the chain without downloading and storing the full chain history. This reduces the storage requirements for light nodes to less than 30 kB.\n\nThe passage explains that there are three types of Bitcoin nodes: full nodes, light nodes, and mining nodes. Light nodes have interesting properties as they can connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without participating in consensus or storing the full chain history. They enable Bitcoin to reach massive scale by allowing participants to utilize the network without steep networking and hardware requirements.\n\nThe BTC Warp project focuses on light nodes because they still need to know the state of and interact with the BTC chain in a trustless way. This is where light nodes play a key role in verifying proof-of-work (PoW) and querying other nodes for data. However, the size of the BTC chain poses a challenge for light clients, as downloading block headers takes time and compute resources scale linearly with the chain's size.\n\nTo address this challenge, the BTC Warp project proposes putting the syncing algorithm inside a zkSNARK. Using zkSNARKs, the project generates a succinct proof of validity for a certain block header, indicating the amount of work associated with it. By verifying this proof, light nodes can sync with the Bitcoin network in constant time without downloading and verifying PoW for each header.\n\nHowever, the size of the BTC chain remains a challenge. The passage mentions that only about 10,000 SHAs (secure hash algorithms) can be fit in a circuit due to the theoretical maximum of Groth16 proving systems. Since BTC has over 780,000 blocks, there are approximately 1.5 million SHAs in the chain. To overcome this limitation, the BTC Warp project uses recursive SNARKs, which can verify other SNARKs. This parallelizes the proof generation process and improves scalability, compute efficiency, and degree of centralization. The project uses Polygon's Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system for this purpose.\n\nGenerating SNARK proofs is computationally expensive, so the project parallelizes the computation to reduce the time required. The passage mentions that the proof generation currently takes about $5000 but can be optimized to be around $1000 for a one-time sync and even less for proof updates for new blocks.\n\nTo support new Bitcoin block headers, the project uses recursive zkSNARKs and chooses a composable tree approach. This approach allows faster and cheaper generation of the initial proof while guaranteeing proofs for blocks produced in the future. However, the construction has a limitation that it can only prove up to a certain block number. To overcome this, the project fills the tree with dummy values until the desired block number is reached. This slightly modifies the circuit to ensure the continuity of proofs.\n\nThe passage also discusses how the project obtains Bitcoin block headers and generates the proofs. They use the Nakamoto light client library, which is written in Rust and provides a Rust-based light client. The light client listens to network activity and updates the proof for new blocks. The project also mentions optimization and benchmarking to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of proof generation.\n\nThe BTC Warp project aims to achieve full-state proving for Bitcoin, allowing the instant verification of all Bitcoin blocks. However, it faces challenges due to the size of the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in a block, which can take over 200GB of storage. The project believes that using efficient data structures within a zkSNARK, such as Utreexo, can make full block and transaction verification possible.\n\nThe passage concludes by mentioning potential use cases for zero shot sync BTC and inviting interested individuals to join the project or partner with them.",

      "summary": "This abstract discusses the fee differences between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees one may expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. The concept of out-of-band fees is explored as a potential explanation for these differences. Out-of-band fees refer to fees paid directly to miners instead of being included in the standard transaction fees.\n\nThe abstract mentions that recent evidence suggests that the increase in fee differences may not be as significant as some people suspect. This indicates that the evidence for increases in out-of-band fees may be limited.\n\nThe abstract also discusses the problem of sending transactions directly to a miner, which slows down block propagation between mining pools. This is because intermediate nodes may not be aware of the transaction, affecting the efficiency of compact blocks. Slow propagation can create centralization pressures within the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that out-of-band fees should ideally not exist since the memory pool is already meant to be an open competitive fee marketplace. However, due to various reasons, out-of-band fees have become popular. These reasons include the desire to ensure faster inclusion in blocks and the need to top up the fee for faster processing.\n\nThe abstract suggests that while it may be unlikely to completely eliminate out-of-band fees, there is a need for work in areas such as education, wallet development, and Bitcoin Core transaction selection policy to minimize the opportunity for such fees.\n\nThe abstract mentions the launch of the website miningpool.observer, which displays candidate blocks from a local instance of Bitcoin Core for every block produced by miners. One key metric analyzed is the fee difference between the local candidate block and the actual mined block.\n\nThere is also a reference to Mempool.space, which has added a similar feature called \"Audit\" to their website. This feature displays the fee difference between actual blocks and block templates.\n\nThe abstract mentions anecdotal comments about actual blocks containing more fees than the block templates, indicating an increase in positive differences. However, this spike may be due to a bug, which has been fixed.\n\nThe abstract includes figures that illustrate the fee differences between actual blocks and block templates. It also shows the increase in Bitcoin fees during the same period and highlights the absence of noticeable variations in the difference data by mining pool.\n\nIn conclusion, the abstract suggests that out-of-band fees may be inevitable and unstoppable, but efforts can be made to minimize their occurrence through education, wallet development, and transaction selection policies. The abstract emphasizes the need for further analysis and research in this area.",

It introduces the concept of out of band fees as a potential explanation for these differences. The abstract notes that there is evidence suggesting that the recent apparent increase in these differences may not be as significant as some people believe, and the evidence for increases in out of band fees may be limited.\n\nTo provide some context, a Bitcoin block is a collection of transactions that are added to the blockchain. Each block is created by a miner who solves a complex mathematical problem, and the miner is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. The fees are paid by users who want their transactions to be prioritized and included in the next block.\n\nThe abstract presents a chart that compares the fees in actual blocks produced by different mining pools with the fees that would be expected based on a local Bitcoin Core node. The chart shows the percentage differences in fees, with a positive number indicating that the actual block fees are higher than the fees in the block templates generated by the Bitcoin Core node.\n\nOne potential problem with sending transactions directly to a miner is that it slows down the propagation of blocks between mining pools. This is because a more efficient method of propagating blocks, called compact blocks, relies on intermediate nodes having knowledge of all transactions. When a transaction is sent directly to a miner, the intermediate nodes may not know about it, causing slower propagation and creating centralization pressure in the network. However, if a transaction is standard and pays enough fees to be included in all mempools (the memory pools where pending transactions are stored), an out of band payment can be used to top up the fee for faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that out of band fees should not ideally exist. The mempool is intended to be an open and competitive fee marketplace, and out of band fees should not be necessary. However, due to various reasons, such as the size of mempools and the desire for faster inclusion, out of band fees are sometimes used. The abstract lists some possible reasons why out of band fees could be popular.\n\nThe abstract concludes that it is highly unlikely that out of band fees will ever be completely eliminated. However, it recognizes that there is still work to be done in terms of education, wallet development, and Bitcoin Core transaction selection policy to minimize the potential opportunity for out of band fees.\n\nThe abstract also mentions the launch of a website called miningpool.observer, which displays a candidate block from its local instance of Bitcoin Core for every block produced by miners.

These charts show the fee differences in BTC and as a percentage of total fees. The charts also differentiate between mining pools but note that there are no noticeable variations in the difference data based on mining pool at this point in time.\n\nOverall, the abstract provides an analysis of fee differences in Bitcoin blocks and explores the concept of out of band fees as a potential explanation.

      "summary": "FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is a protocol that involves multiple parties, each generating a secret polynomial and sharing evaluations of this polynomial with others to create a distributed FROST key. The final FROST key is represented by a joint polynomial, where the intercept at x=0 is the jointly shared secret, denoted as s=f(0). Each participant has control over a single point on this polynomial based on their participant index.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials, denoted as T-1, sets the threshold T of the multisignature. This determines the number of points required to interpolate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret. In simpler terms, the threshold indicates how many parties need to collaborate to perform certain operations without revealing the secret in isolation. In contrast to Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret needs to be reconstructed, FROST allows for interpolation of evaluations without explicitly reconstructing the secret.\n\nThe question arises whether it is possible to change the number of signers (denoted as N) and the threshold (denoted as T) after the key generation process has been completed. Importantly, the focus is on whether these changes can be made with the involvement of a threshold number of signers rather than requiring the consent of all N signers. For instance, if a FROST secret keyshare is lost and needs to be reissued.\n\nUpon investigation, it has been found that many of the ideas related to this topic have already been explored in the secret sharing literature. However, the specifics and security considerations need to be examined further. The following methods are mentioned, and although not explicitly explained, they provide a starting point for further research.\n\nOne approach to changing a t of n threshold (where t < n) to a t of (n-1) is to trust one user to delete their secret keyshare. It is crucial to ensure that the value of n is greater than t in this case. If there is uncertainty about whether the party will reliably delete their secret keyshare, an alternative can be considered. This involves making the revoked secret keyshares incompatible with future multisignature participants. Proactive secret sharing methods can be utilized for this purpose.\n\nProactive secret sharing involves periodically renewing the shares without changing the secret. This renewal ensures that any information gained by an adversary during a specific time period becomes useless for attacking the secret after the shares are renewed. Methods like Proactive Secret Sharing and Commitment Schemes are relevant in this context.\n\nTo create a new joint polynomial with the same joint secret and public key, the key generation process can be repeated with n-1 parties. Each participant uses the same first coefficient as in their original keygen polynomial, while the other terms are randomly chosen. This process yields a polynomial with the same joint secret but with different points that are incompatible with previous keyshares.\n\nDecreasing the threshold can be achieved by sharing a secret of a single party with all other signers. This allows the other parties to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. Essentially, this transforms a t of n threshold into a (t-1) of (n-1) threshold. If the goal is to maintain the same number of signers (N), it is necessary to know how to increase the number of signers. This can be accomplished by issuing a brand new secret keyshare and distributing it to all other signers.\n\nIn more adversarial multisig scenarios, steps can be taken to manage a fair exchange of the secret to ensure that it reaches all participants. However, it is important to note that simply backing up individual secret keyshares is not the same as issuing an additional party with the power to contribute an independent signature share towards the threshold. The process of issuing new signers requires further consideration and is slightly more involved.\n\nAnother concept to explore is securely evaluating the joint polynomial at indexes corresponding to additional participants. This is done without relying on the presence of all N participants, which is useful in the case of a lost signer. Enrollment protocols can be used to add a new party without redoing keygen. These protocols involve a threshold number of parties collaborating to evaluate the joint polynomial at a new participant index and securely sharing this new secret keyshare with the new participant.\n\nTo add a new party at a new participant index, T parties each use their secret keyshare point to evaluate the joint polynomial at that index. Each party contributes evaluation shares using their basis polynomial and applies the appropriate lagrange factor to ensure that the sum of these shares lies on the joint polynomial. By securely sharing these shares with the new party, the new party can sum them to form a secret keyshare and participate in FROST signing. Furthermore, if provided with the original commitment polynomials used during keygen, the new party can verify that their received point indeed lies on the joint polynomial.\n\nProof of concept recovery of a signer and enrollment of a new signer can be achieved without requiring multiparty computation (MPC) communication. Although this approach may be more complex and less flexible than an enrollment protocol, it may be easier to implement and prove secure. The method involves modifying the standard keygen process, where each party evaluates their secret scalar polynomial from 1 to n but also evaluates from n+1 to n+k. This generates k extra secret shares that can be used later to issue a new signer.\n\nTo add a new signer to the FROST multisignature, the new signer needs to receive these secret shares from every other keygen participant. However, simply distributing these secret shares among the participants is not feasible, as it may lead to the premature creation of additional signers. Instead, Shamir Secret Sharing can be used to share the secret shares, thus reintroducing the threshold. These shares are referred to as \"fragments\" of secret shares rather than shares-of-shares. To issue a new signer, T signers need to send all the fragments they hold that belong to index n+1. By collecting at least T x N fragments, it is possible to recreate N secret shares, which are then combined to form a new signer with their own point on the joint polynomial.\n\nIncreasing the threshold appears to be more challenging than redoing keygen, as it would require increasing the degree of the polynomial and trusting everyone to delete the old one.\n\nThis detailed explanation provides an overview of FROST's distributed key generation, the relationship between the number of signers and the threshold, and potential methods for changing these parameters after keygen. The implementation and security considerations of these methods need further exploration.",
      "summaryeli15": "FROST's distributed key generation involves multiple parties, let's say N parties. Each party creates a secret polynomial, which is a mathematical equation that only they know. They then share evaluations of this polynomial with other parties. By doing this, they create a distributed FROST key.\n\nThe final FROST key is described by a joint polynomial, which is another mathematical equation. The x=0 intercept of this polynomial represents the jointly shared secret, which we can call \"s\". Each participant in the key generation process controls a single point on this polynomial, based on their participant index.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials determines the threshold T of the multisignature. This means that the number of points required to evaluate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret is determined by the degree, which is T-1.\n\nNow, here comes the interesting part. T parties can interact to interpolate evaluations using the secret f[0] (the secret shared point at x=0) without actually reconstructing this secret in isolation. In other words, they can perform operations on this secret without explicitly knowing its value. This is different from Shamir Secret Sharing, where you need to reconstruct the secret.\n\nNow, let's address the questions about changing the number of signers N and the threshold T after the key generation process has been completed. Can these changes be made by a threshold number of signers, instead of requiring the consent of all N signers?\n\nYes, it is possible to change the number of signers N and the threshold T after the key generation process. One way to achieve this is by using proactive secret sharing. This involves periodically renewing the shares without changing the secret itself. By doing this, any information gained by an adversary in one time period becomes useless for attacking the secret after the shares are renewed.\n\nTo decrease the threshold T, you can share a secret from a single party to all other signers. This allows every other party to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. Essentially, this reduces the threshold from a t of n to a (t-1) of (n-1). If you also know how to increase the number of signers, you can keep the number of signers N the same and go from a t of n to a (t-1) of n.\n\nIn more adversarial scenarios, steps can be taken to manage a fair exchange of this secret to ensure it reaches all participants. This is crucial to maintaining the security of the system.\n\nEnrollment protocols can be used to add a new party without redoing the key generation process. This involves a threshold number of parties collaborating to evaluate the joint polynomial at a new participant index and securely sharing the new secret keyshare with the new participant. This allows them to participate in the FROST signing process.\n\nAnother method involves modifying the key generation process to generate extra secret shares that can later be used to add new signers. These secret shares are distributed to all participants. To issue a new signer later on, you need to collect these secret shares from a threshold number of signers. This ensures that enough fragments of secret shares are collected to recreate the necessary secret shares for the new signer.\n\nIncreasing the threshold seems more difficult than redoing the key generation process. It would require the entire group to somehow increase the degree of the polynomial and trust everyone to delete the old one.\n\nOverall, FROST provides a flexible and secure way to generate and manage distributed keys, allowing for changes in the number of signers and the threshold. Further research and implementation are needed to ensure the security and practicality of these methods mentioned.",

      "summary": "In this blog post, the author describes the process of adding and removing HTLCs (Hashed Timelock Contracts) in a Lightning Network channel. The post assumes that the channel has already been opened by Alice and Bob and their funding transaction has been confirmed.\n\nTo begin, the author presents a simplified diagram of Alice and Bob's initial channel state, excluding the funding transaction and output details. This simplification allows for a clearer focus on adding and removing HTLC outputs.\n\nWhen either Alice or Bob wants to send a payment across the channel, they need to propose the inclusion of an HTLC to their channel peer. This is done using the \"update_add_htlc\" message, which includes information such as the channel ID, an identifier for the proposed change, the amount to be attached to the HTLC output, the block height at which the HTLC should expire, and data for the recipient to determine where to send the payment.\n\nIf Alice proposes an HTLC (A1) to Bob, Bob can add it to his staging area commitment transaction, while Alice marks it as pending on Bob's side without adding it to her commitment transaction yet. However, neither side has actually committed to the HTLC at this point.\n\nAlice can continue adding more changes to the staging area, proposing another HTLC (A2) to Bob. These changes can accumulate in the staging area without being irrevocably committed by both parties.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers will want to ensure that the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending the \"commitment_signed\" message. If Alice sends this message to Bob, Bob will have all the required signatures from Alice to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction.\n\nAfter receiving Alice's commitment_signed message, Bob can now revoke his previous state and send the \"revoke_and_ack\" message. This message includes information about which HTLCs have been committed to and allows both parties to update their commitment transactions accordingly.\n\nThe commitment transactions can remain out of sync indefinitely, and Bob doesn't need to send commitment_signed just because Alice did. This flexibility is demonstrated when Alice sends another HTLC (A3) to Bob.\n\nTo remove an HTLC, the peer who did not send the original update_add_htlc message needs to send an update_*_htlc message. The update_fulfill_htlc message is used to remove an HTLC when it is being fulfilled, while the update_fail_htlc message is used when an HTLC fails due to timeouts or routing failures.\n\nThe update_fail_malformed_htlc message is sent when a hop cannot parse the onion_routing_packet it received in the update_add_htlc message.\n\nAfter all the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed, they can be removed. HTLCs that are fulfilled can be removed using the update_fulfill_htlc message, while failed HTLCs can be removed using the update_fail_htlc or update_fail_malformed_htlc messages.\n\nClosing a channel in a cooperative way requires both peers to agree on a final closing transaction that will spend from the funding transaction and pay each of them their final channel balance. Once all the HTLCs have been cleared, the peers can negotiate a fee for the final closing transaction.\n\nAssuming Alice was the funder of the channel, she chooses a fee rate, constructs the closing transaction, signs it, and sends the closing_signed message to Bob. This message includes the fee in satoshis used for the closing transaction proposal and Alice's signature. Alice can also include minimum and maximum fee values for Bob to consider when sending a counterproposal.\n\nIf Bob is unhappy with Alice's proposal, he can send a counterproposal with a different fee rate and his signature. Both parties can continue negotiating until they reach an agreement on the fee rate.\n\nOnce the closing transaction is signed by both parties, it can be broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and eventually confirmed, officially closing the channel. Any nodes that had this channel in their routing graph will remove it from their graph once they see the channel's funding output has been spent.\n\nThe blog post concludes that the beauty of the Lightning Network channel is that the only transactions that appear on-chain are the opening and closing transactions, even though many HTLCs may have been exchanged between Alice and Bob throughout the lifetime of the channel.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this blog post, the author discusses the process of adding and removing HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) in a payment channel between Alice and Bob. \n\nFirst, let's understand what a payment channel is. A payment channel is a mechanism in the Lightning Network, a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, that allows users to make off-chain transactions. It creates a temporary communication tunnel between two parties (in this case, Alice and Bob) to securely exchange transactions without needing to broadcast them on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTo open the payment channel, Alice and Bob need to create a funding transaction. Once this transaction is confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain, Alice and Bob exchange a \"channel_ready\" message to indicate that they are ready to use the channel. \n\nNow, let's discuss the state of the asymmetric commitment transactions. The author provides diagrams to explain this. However, for simplicity, they omit the funding transaction and some other outputs. The diagrams show the current state of Alice and Bob's commitment transactions, which represent the agreed-upon balances between them.\n\nWhen either Alice or Bob wants to send a payment through the channel, they need to propose the inclusion of an HTLC. HTLCs are used to lock funds in a multi-signature output with a time lock. This ensures that the funds can only be spent by the intended recipient within a certain time frame.\n\nTo propose an HTLC, the sender (in this case, Alice) sends an \"update_add_htlc\" message to the receiver (Bob). This message includes the channel ID, an identifier for the proposed change, the amount to be attached to the HTLC output, the block height at which the HTLC should expire, and data that the recipient will use to determine where to send the payment next.\n\nIf Bob is happy with the proposed HTLC, he adds it to his staging commitment transaction, while Alice marks the HTLC as pending on Bob's side. However, neither side has committed to the HTLC yet.\n\nIt's important to note that if Bob is a routing node for this payment, he should not send an \"update_add_HTLC\" message to the next hop until the HTLC has been irrevocably committed. An HTLC addition or removal is considered irrevocably committed once both parties in the channel have committed to the commitment transaction with or without it.\n\nAfter this, Alice can propose another HTLC (i.e., A2) to Bob. Both parties can continue proposing changes to the staging area.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers will want to make sure the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending a \"commitment_signed\" message. For example, if Alice sends this message to Bob, Bob will have all the required signatures from Alice to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction.\n\nBob then sends a \"revoke_and_ack\" message to acknowledge Alice's commitment and to revoke his previous state. It's important to note that Bob now has two valid commitment transactions, but he is incentivized to revoke his previous commitment transaction.\n\nThis process of proposing changes, revoking previous state, and gaining acknowledgement continues until all the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed.\n\nTo remove HTLCs, payment success or failure is considered. The sender of the original \"update_add_htlc\" initiates the removal. If the payment is successful, an \"update_fulfilled_htlc\" message is sent. If the payment fails, an \"update_fail_htlc\" or \"update_fail_malformed_htlc\" message is sent.\n\nOnce all the HTLCs have been removed, Alice and Bob can start negotiating a fee for the final closing transaction. The funder of the channel (in this case, Alice) initiates the negotiation. Alice chooses a fee rate, constructs the closing transaction, and signs it. She sends the \"closing_signed\" message to Bob. Bob may accept the proposal or send a counterproposal with a different fee rate.\n\nEventually, the closing transaction is broadcasted on the Bitcoin blockchain, signaling the official closure of the channel.\n\nIn summary, the blog post explains the process of adding and removing HTLCs in a payment channel. It emphasizes the importance of commitment, revocation, and negotiation between the parties involved. By using payment channels, users can perform numerous transactions off-chain, reducing congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.",

      "summary": "The Lightning Network is a payment network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for fast, scalable, and trust-minimized transactions by utilizing payment channels between nodes. These nodes relay payments and manage private keys that control the funds involved.\n\nOperating a Lightning node poses significant security challenges because private keys need to be online at all times, making them a prime target for hackers. ACINQ, one of the main developers and operators of the Lightning Network, has spent years researching and developing a secure solution for their Lightning node.\n\nTheir chosen setup consists of two key components: AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano. AWS Nitro Enclaves is an Isolated Compute Environment provided by Amazon Web Services, while Ledger Nano is a hardware device with a trusted display for secure signing operations.\n\nThe deployment of their Lightning node involves several considerations. Firstly, the ACINQ team self-host their node on AWS instead of using physical cards due to the need for flexibility offered by cloud providers. This necessitates splitting their deployment into two parts: the Lightning implementation running on AWS and the HSM (Hardware Security Module) for secure key storage.\n\nHowever, simply using a traditional HSM was not sufficient for their needs. They needed to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSM to ensure secure routing of payments. This proved to be a challenging task due to the confined nature of HSMs and the stateful nature of the Lightning protocol.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, ACINQ decided to store encrypted data on the HSM's host filesystem and pass it back and forth during payment transactions. This introduced further complexity and created a deployment with three logical parts: Eclair, the HSM host filesystem, and the HSM itself.\n\nMoreover, the HSM also needed to have knowledge of the Bitcoin blockchain to verify the validity of payment channels. Authenticating channels required more than a simple presentation of transaction data, as there were various corner cases to consider. Ensuring the HSM could accurately verify the blockchain data added to the complexity of the system.\n\nACINQ initially developed a complete application for an HSM but realized the high development and maintenance costs and the operational burden associated with it. They sought a more effective solution and found that AWS Nitro Enclaves provided a superior option. This allowed them to use a secure runtime environment for their Lightning node without the need for a full HSM implementation.\n\nWith Nitro Enclaves, ACINQ can run their Eclair application securely, benefiting from the confidentiality and integrity guarantees provided by Nitro Enclaves. They developed a custom protocol called \"LINK\" to manage network connections within the enclave, establishing secure channels between the enclave and external destinations.\n\nTo further secure their secrets, ACINQ built a \"master\" repository within a Nitro Enclave that only trusted administrators can access. Secrets are packaged in encrypted blobs using an air-gapped machine and transferred securely to the master enclave for decryption. During node startup, a secure tunnel is created between the node and the master enclave to retrieve the secrets.\n\nACINQ also utilizes Ledger Nano devices to enhance the security of their Lightning node. The trusted display of Ledger devices allows administrators to sign sensitive operations, such as starting and stopping the node or managing APIs, with a similar user experience to using a Ledger device with Bitcoin wallets. The Ledger devices are configured to trust the ACINQ launcher application, which runs inside Nitro Enclaves.\n\nBeyond securing the Lightning node, ACINQ leverages Nitro Enclaves to enhance the security of their Bitcoin core operations as well. Eclair inside the enclave can verify Bitcoin transactions, detect and react when they are spent, and connect to different Bitcoin data sources to validate the main Bitcoin node's synchronization with the network.\n\nThe integration of Nitro Enclaves and Ledger devices has allowed ACINQ to achieve a high level of security for their Lightning node while balancing considerations of cost and maintainability. The deployment and operational processes have been designed to minimize complexity and rely on familiar tools and actions. ACINQ developers are not impacted by Nitro and can continue working with Eclair and the Nitro toolkits as separate projects.\n\nThe use of Nitro Enclaves also provides flexibility, as the solution could potentially be replicated on other platforms deploying Confidential Computing Environments. ACINQ's solution with Nitro Enclaves and Ledger devices offers a strong trade-off between security, cost, and maintainability, making it a suitable choice for high-capacity Lightning nodes.",
      "summaryeli15": "ACINQ is a company that develops and operates the Lightning Network, which is a payment network built on top of Bitcoin. The Lightning Network allows for fast and scalable transactions, but operating a Lightning Network node comes with security challenges because private keys need to be online all the time.\n\nTo secure their Lightning node, ACINQ has spent years researching and testing different solutions. They have settled on using a combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano. AWS Nitro Enclaves are isolated compute environments provided by Amazon Web Services, and they provide a secure environment for running the Lightning node. Ledger Nano is a hardware device with a trusted display that is used for signing transactions.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a network of nodes that relay payments. These nodes are reachable from the Internet, process real-time transactions, and manage private keys that control the funds. Since private keys are valuable targets for hackers, operating a Lightning node poses security risks.\n\nACINQ has developed an open-source Lightning implementation called Eclair, which is specifically designed for large workloads. Eclair runs on the JVM and can easily scale to a large number of payment channels with high transaction volume. ACINQ's Lightning node, which runs on Eclair, currently manages hundreds of BTC and tens of thousands of channels.\n\nTo secure their Lightning node, ACINQ initially developed a full Lightning implementation for a hardware security module (HSM). However, they later discovered AWS Nitro Enclaves, which offered a superior solution. They designed a new solution that involves using Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano for authentication operations.\n\nThe Lightning Network allows for off-chain payments, which means that payments made through the network do not need to be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows for a virtually unlimited throughput. Payments in the Lightning Network are routed through nodes, and ACINQ operates as a routing node, meaning they forward payments rather than sending or receiving them.\n\nSecuring a Lightning node involves more than just protecting private keys. ACINQ had to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSM to ensure that outgoing payments match with incoming payments. This required storing encrypted data on the HSM's host filesystem and passing it back and forth during payment transactions.\n\nIn addition to securing payment transactions, ACINQ also had to ensure the security of the payment channels themselves. Lightning payments are only safe because they happen in channels anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain. ACINQ had to implement mechanisms to authenticate and verify the channels using the blockchain.\n\nImplementing security measures for the Lightning node proved to be a complex and challenging task. ACINQ's solution required significant custom development and added complexity to their deployment. The HSM application they developed turned out to be larger than expected, and the performance of HSMs was not sufficient for processing a large number of payments.\n\nTrusted execution environments (TEEs) like AWS Nitro Enclaves were designed to protect keys and not for running complex applications like ACINQ's Lightning node. However, ACINQ found that Nitro Enclaves provided a secure runtime that allowed them to run their application without splitting it into trusted and untrusted parts.\n\nACINQ also made use of Ledger devices to enhance the security of their Lightning node. Ledger devices have trusted displays that allow administrators to validate and sign sensitive operations. By combining Nitro Enclaves with Ledger devices, ACINQ was able to secure their Lightning node and perform sensitive operations without the need for air-gapped machines.\n\nACINQ's solution using AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger devices provided a high level of security while also maintaining flexibility and ease of operation. They were able to run their Lightning node securely in a production environment and handle management tasks and upgrades effectively. The solution was also portable, allowing them to potentially migrate to other cloud providers that offer Confidential Computing Environments.\n\nOverall, ACINQ's solution represents a successful approach to securing a professional Lightning node, considering the trade-off between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity.",

The Liquid Network is a sidechain-capable blockchain platform. It is open-source, meaning that its source code is openly available for anyone to view and modify. \n\nThe text also mentions the availability of real-time and historical cryptocurrency trade data, as well as the existence of a hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid. A hardware wallet is a physical device that securely stores a user's private keys, which are necessary for accessing their cryptocurrency funds. \n\nIn addition to these specific features and tools, the text provides a detailed explanation of the Simplicity programming language itself. It states that Simplicity expressions are constructed from combinators, which are used to build up expressions from smaller ones. These expressions represent functions that take input and produce output.\n\nThe text then provides an example of a simple Simplicity program that takes an empty input and produces an empty output. It goes on to explain how side effects are used in programming languages to interact with the outside world, such as the transaction being spent. Simplicity programs also have access to key-value data stores, which allow them to maintain state across transactions without passing it explicitly.\n\nThe text compares Simplicity with other programming languages like Bitcoin Script and EVM, mentioning that Simplicity can be more verbose for simple operations like bit inversion. However, such operations are typically written only once and then reused, and the language provides shortcuts to simplify the code.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions that although Simplicity provides a foundation for blockchain programs, the actual work is often done in higher-level languages that compile down to Simplicity code. These higher-level languages also provide proofs of their correct operation.\n\nThe text explains that Simplicity expressions with trivial input and output values are called programs. These expressions only allow for a single function that maps a trivial input to a trivial output. The strategy in Simplicity involves having holes in programs that are filled in when coins are spent, as well as using side effects to access blockchain data or abort the program.\n\nTo specify holes in Simplicity programs, the text mentions the use of the disconnect and witness combinators. The witness combinator returns a value of a given type, such as a digital signature or hash preimage. Side effects in Simplicity are supported through introspecting transaction data and using assertions, which halt the program execution if certain conditions are not met.\n\nThe text provides an example of a Simplicity program that checks two witnesses for equality. It explains how the program is constructed using different combinators and goes on to mention that Simplicity has several more combinators and jets, which will be discussed in future posts.\n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that future posts will explore the concept of sharing, which allows identical expressions to be merged into one. It also encourages readers to join the Simplicity discussions on GitHub and follow @blksresearch on Twitter for updates.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! I'll break down the provided information in a way that is easier for a 15-year-old to understand.\n\n1. API to issue and manage digital assets on the Liquid Network:\nAn API is a set of functions and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. In this case, the API allows developers to create and manage digital assets (like cryptocurrencies) on a network called the Liquid Network.\n\n2. Real-time and historical cryptocurrency trade data:\nThis means that there is a way to access and retrieve data about the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in real-time (as it happens) and also look at past trading data.\n\n3. An open-source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform:\nA blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes. This platform is open-source, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, use, and modify. It is also \"sidechain-capable,\" which means it can support additional blockchains that are connected to the main blockchain.\n\n4. A fully open-source hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid:\nA hardware wallet is a physical device that securely stores cryptocurrency private keys, which are needed to access and manage cryptocurrency holdings. This hardware wallet is open-source, meaning its design and source code can be freely accessed and studied by anyone.\n\n5. A multi-platform, feature-rich Bitcoin and Liquid wallet:\nThis is a software application that allows users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin and Liquid cryptocurrencies. It can be used on different types of devices (like computers, smartphones, etc.) and offers a range of features to make managing cryptocurrencies easier.\n\n6. Search data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains:\nThis refers to a tool or function that allows users to search for specific information or data within the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains. This can be used to find particular transactions, addresses, or other relevant data.\n\nNow let's talk about Simplicity, which is a programming language:\n\nSimplicity is a programming language that is used in the context of blockchain technology. It is different from most other programming languages because it focuses on building expressions from smaller ones, rather than using statements or instructions.\n\nIn Simplicity, expressions represent functions that take an input and produce an output. The language is designed to be simple and easy to understand.\n\nThe provided example shows a Simplicity program that starts with a simple expression that does nothing (main := iden). Then, it introduces a more interesting expression that takes a bit (a binary value: either 0 or 1) and inverts it.\n\nIn programming languages like Simplicity, side effects are ways for the program to interact with the outside world or maintain state. In Simplicity, side effects are achieved through different ways, such as accessing blockchain data or aborting program execution. These are important for blockchain programs to work effectively.\n\nSimplicity also allows the use of shortcuts or pre-built functions to make programming easier and more efficient. For example, instead of writing the code to invert a bit manually, there is a predefined function called \"jet_not\" that can be used.\n\nFurthermore, the example explains that while Simplicity provides a foundation for programming blockchain applications, the actual work is often done in higher-level languages that compile down to Simplicity code. This allows for more complex applications to be built on top of Simplicity.\n\nThe example also mentions the concepts of holes and witnesses in Simplicity programs. Holes are areas in the program that can be filled in later when certain conditions are met (like spending coins). Witnesses, on the other hand, are values that serve as inputs to the program. By combining witnesses and assertions (outputs), Simplicity programs can perform useful computations.\n\nThe example ends by mentioning that Simplicity has various combinators and jets that allow for more complex programming. Combinators are building blocks for creating expressions, and jets are pre-built functions that can be used in programming. The post suggests that future posts will explore these topics more in-depth and provide practical examples.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the given information better!

      "summary": "A two-way peg is a mechanism that allows the transfer of a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin (BTC), between different blockchain networks. In this case, the two-way peg is being used to bridge BTC to other chains.\n\nThe process is similar to a perpetual one-way peg, where BTC is typically burned and permanently transferred to another chain. However, instead of burning the BTC, it is locked up for a specific period of time, in this case, 20 years. This means that the BTC cannot be accessed or moved until the specified time has passed.\n\nDuring this lock-up period, the community needs to find a way to perform peg-outs, which refers to the process of moving the locked BTC from one chain to another. To achieve this, they may need to use techniques such as OP_ZKP_VERIFY (Zero-Knowledge Proof Verify) or Simplicity, which are cryptographic methods that allow for secure and verifiable transactions without revealing sensitive information.\n\nTo facilitate the locking of BTC, the script uses an opcode called OP_ZKP_VERIFY, which functions similarly to the existing opcode OP_NOP10 (No Operation 10). However, it is designed specifically for zero-knowledge proof verification. When executed, OP_ZKP_VERIFY reads data from the stack (the temporary storage location for the blockchain's execution) and the unlocking script (the script that allows the locked BTC to be released).\n\nThe more BTC that is locked using this script, the greater the incentive for the community to solve the challenge of peg-outs. This means that if a larger amount of BTC is locked, it increases the motivation for individuals or groups to find a solution for moving the locked BTC onto other chains.\n\nThe concept for this two-way peg mechanism was initially proposed by Burak, with contributions from Super Testnet and another individual named Jeremy Rubin. It is worth noting that this idea has similarities to Jeremy Rubin's idea for betting on Taproot activation, which is another proposed improvement to the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nFinally, the script includes OP_CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify), which ensures that the locked BTC cannot be unlocked before a particular time specified in the script. OP_2DROP is also used to remove unnecessary items from the stack after verification.\n\nOverall, this detailed description explains the concept of a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains, the locking mechanism of the BTC, the need for peg-outs, and the use of cryptographic techniques like OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity.",
      "summaryeli15": "At its core, a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains is a mechanism that allows Bitcoin (BTC) to be converted and used on other blockchain networks. This process involves \"pegging\" the Bitcoin to another chain, essentially locking it up for a specific period of time.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Perpetual one-way peg: First, it's important to understand the concept of a one-way peg. In a one-way peg, BTC is sent to a specific address or script on the Bitcoin blockchain, and in return, an equivalent amount of tokens is created on the other chain, which can only be used on that chain.\n\n2. Two-way peg: In a two-way peg, BTC is also sent to an address or script, but instead of being burned (destroyed) as in a one-way peg, the BTC is locked up for a particular period, let's say 20 years. This means that the BTC cannot be spent or used for any transactions on the Bitcoin network until the lockup period expires.\n\n3. Figuring out peg-outs: The community must find a way to allow the locked BTC to be used on other chains. This can be achieved through the implementation of specific functionalities within the script. For example, the script may include an operation called OP_ZKP_VERIFY (Zero-Knowledge Proof Verify) or Simplicity, which are cryptographic techniques used to prove the validity of certain statements without revealing sensitive information.\n\n4. Locking BTC in the script: To enable this functionality, users can \"pretend\" that another operation called OP_NOP10 (No Operation 10) is actually OP_ZKP_VERIFY. They can then lock their BTC in a script using a combination of operations like OP_NOP10, OP_CLTV (Check LockTime Verify), and OP_2DROP. These operations help ensure that the BTC is securely locked and can only be unlocked according to certain conditions, such as the lockup period expiration.\n\n5. Incentive to solve the problem: The more BTC that is locked in the script, the greater the incentive for the community to find solutions for enabling peg-outs. This means that if a significant amount of BTC is locked up, there will be more motivation for developers and users to come up with ways to utilize these locked funds on other chains, thus bridging the gap between Bitcoin and other networks.\n\n6. Credit to contributors: The idea of a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains is not the work of a single person. Burak, Super Testnet, and the speaker (who mentions \"I\") have all contributed to developing and refining this concept. It is worth noting that this idea bears similarities to Jeremy Rubin's proposal for betting on Taproot activation, which is another mechanism aimed at enhancing the Bitcoin network.\n\nOverall, a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains allows Bitcoin to be used on different blockchain networks by temporarily locking it up, while the community collaboratively works on implementing solutions for enabling peg-outs.",
