      "summary": "On May 26, 2023, Michael Ford sent a message informing the Bitcoin community that Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available. This version can be downloaded from the following link: https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/. Alternatively, it can also be obtained from the GitHub repository owned by Peter Todd at: https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/full-rbf-v25.0. To clone the repository, the command to use is: git clone -b full-rbf-v25.0 https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git.\n\nSo, what is this version of Bitcoin Core and what is its significance? Bitcoin Core v25.0 includes Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, along with some additional minor updates. The full-rbf feature is designed to improve transaction replacement protocols in the Bitcoin network. With full-rbf, two main changes are introduced for nodes that enable this feature:\n\n1) The node advertises a FULL_RBF service bit when the mempoolfullrbf option is set to 1. This means that the node signals to the network that it supports the full-rbf protocol.\n\n2) The node connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. By doing so, a core group of nodes dedicated to propagating full-rbf replacements is established. This ensures that transactions using full-rbf replacement are reliably communicated throughout the network.\n\nIt is worth noting that not everyone needs to run the full-rbf version, but it would be beneficial if more people did. To understand why running full-rbf is important, you can read a blog post by Peter Todd at the following link: https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf.\n\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that there is a tweet by Peter Todd showcasing hats related to full-rbf. The tweet can be found at: https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1659996011086110720/photo/1.\n\nFinally, the email from Michael Ford includes a non-text attachment named \"signature.asc\" with the type \"application/pgp-signature\" and a size of 833 bytes. However, no further information is provided about this attachment.",
      "summaryeli15": "The email you shared is from Michael Ford, who is providing information about a new release of Bitcoin Core, version v25.0. Bitcoin Core is a software program that is used to run a full Bitcoin node. A Bitcoin node is a computer that participates in the Bitcoin network by validating and propagating transactions and blocks.\n\nThe new version, v25.0, includes a feature called \"full-rbf\" which stands for \"full replace-by-fee.\" Replace-by-fee is a feature that allows you to increase the fee of a Bitcoin transaction after it has been broadcasted, potentially expediting its confirmation. Full-rbf means that all transactions on the network are eligible for replacement by fee.\n\nThe purpose of the update is to improve the propagation of full-rbf transactions. This is done by advertising a service bit when the mempoolfullrbf setting is enabled, and connecting to four additional peers that also support full-rbf. By doing this, a core group of nodes will reliably spread and propagate these transactions.\n\nIt is important to note that not everyone needs to run this version with full-rbf. However, it would be helpful if more people did so, as it would enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the network.\n\nIf you are interested in understanding why running full-rbf is beneficial, you can check out a blog post by Peter Todd, which explains the advantages. Additionally, there is a tweet with hats related to the release, which you can find on Twitter.\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining the updated version, you can download it from the provided links.",

They reference a previous discussion where they mentioned the potential for upgrading the Bitcoin layer 1 blockchain through the introduction of client-side validation. This upgrade aims to address the scalability and privacy issues that currently exist within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nClient-side validation refers to the process of validating transactions on the client side rather than relying solely on the blockchain. By moving most of the validation work to the client, the proposed upgrade claims to be more efficient than the existing Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nThe announcement introduces a new proposal called Prime, which aims to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol with a new layer 1 that is scalable and fully anonymous. This proposed upgrade would allow for billions of transactions per minute and would shift most of the validation work to the client-side validation system. It should be noted that this upgrade can be implemented without a softfork and miner upgrade, although it could benefit from them. Importantly, this upgrade would not impact users who choose not to upgrade and does not require consensus or majority for initial deployment.\n\nThe announcement also states that this proposed upgrade would make Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant. It suggests that things like BRC20, inscriptions, and ordinals would become impossible, and that RGB smart contracts would be the solution for proper assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other related functionalities. By doing this, it aims to eliminate the need for non-users to store, validate, and use their network bandwidth for third-party interests.\n\nA link to the white paper detailing the proposal is included in the announcement. The LNP/BP Standards Association is forming a working group focused on the formal specification and reference implementation of this new layer. They invite anyone interested to join and cooperate on this topic. Additionally, they plan to conduct educational and workshop activities to help the community better understand the technology and make informed decisions about its adoption.\n\nThe announcement also emphasizes that this infrastructural effort should be managed by a non-profit organization and funded through non-profit donations.

      "summaryeli15": "In this email thread, Salvatore Ingala is discussing the MATT (Miniscript Amenable Taproot Transactions) proposal for smart contracts in Bitcoin. MATT is a framework that allows for the creation of arbitrary smart contracts using fraud proofs. \n\nThe core functionality of MATT is relatively simple. It introduces two new opcodes, OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY and OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, which enhance the Script language used in Bitcoin. These opcodes allow for the embedding of data in transaction outputs and facilitate the verification of that data in subsequent transactions. \n\nThe OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY opcode is used to verify that the script of the current input in a transaction matches a certain value, which is typically passed through the witness stack. The OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY opcode is used to verify that a specific output in a transaction has a certain script and/or embedded data. \n\nThese opcodes provide a form of introspection that is not currently possible in Bitcoin's Script language. They allow for the verification of specific conditions in a transaction, such as the presence of certain data or the adherence to a specific script. \n\nMATT is not yet fully formalized, and there are additional opcodes and features that can be added to it. The current implementation of MATT focuses on the core opcodes and demonstrates how they can be used to create vaults that are similar to those built with OP_VAULT. Vaults are a type of smart contract that allow for the secure storage and management of funds. \n\nThe email provides an example of how MATT can be used to create a vault. The vault has two states, [V] (the initial vault UTXO(s)) and [U] (the utxo produced by the \"trigger transaction\" during unvaulting). The script of the [V] state includes the trigger script, which requires specific data in the witness stack to be executed. The script of the [U] state includes the withdrawal script, which verifies the timing of the transaction and the correctness of the output scripts. \n\nThroughout the email, Salvatore discusses various aspects of MATT, including its similarities and differences with other proposals like OP_VAULT and OP_CTV. He also mentions the potential use of Simplicity, a language that aims to replace Script with a better language for Bitcoin scripting. Overall, he argues that MATT is a simple and effective framework for smart contracts in Bitcoin, and it can be easily implemented and audited.",

      "summary": "In this message, the author is discussing the current status of the taproot annex, which is a part of the bitcoin protocol. They state that the taproot annex is currently valid in terms of consensus but is considered non-standard.\n\nThe author mentions that conversations regarding standardization of the taproot annex are happening, and there is a leaning towards adopting a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. TLV is a way of encoding data where each data item is preceded by a type indicator and a length indicator. This format has the potential to offer various benefits but may require a significant amount of time to finalize.\n\nHowever, the author suggests that in the meantime, it would be beneficial to make the taproot annex available in a non-structured form. This means allowing developers to use the annex without specific constraints on its format. By doing so, developers can take advantage of the features of the taproot annex immediately instead of waiting for the standardization process to complete.\n\nThe author proposes that any annex that starts with the digit '0' should be considered free-form, meaning it can follow any format without any additional constraints. They mention several benefits of this approach:\n\n1. Immediate utilization: Developers can start using the taproot annex right away for various applications without waiting for the implementation of a structured format like TLV.\n\n2. Future flexibility: By keeping the '0'-beginning annexes free-form, options remain open for future developments and improvements to the structure. This ensures that the structure of the annex is not set prematurely and allows for adaptation as needed.\n\n3. Chainspace efficiency: Non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a probable TLV format. A TLV format would need to encode the length even when there is only one field, potentially leading to increased overhead.\n\nIn conclusion, the author believes that adopting this approach will broaden the utilization scope of the taproot annex immediately while still allowing for a transition to a more structured format in the future. They consider this approach to be pragmatic and efficient, offering substantial benefits in both the short and long term.\n\nThe message ends with a reference to a GitHub page [1] that likely contains more detailed information or discussions related to the taproot annex.\n\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1381",

Let's break it down together!\n\nIn this text, Joost is talking about something called the taproot annex. Currently, the taproot annex is considered valid but not standard. However, there are discussions happening about potentially standardizing it by using a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format.\n\nThe TLV format is a way to structure data, where each piece of information is represented by a type, length, and value. It has the potential to be very useful, but deciding on the exact format could take a lot of time. In the meantime, Joost suggests making the taproot annex available in a non-structured form.\n\nBy doing this, developers can start using the taproot annex right away without having to wait for a structured format like TLV to be finalized. This allows them to take advantage of its features immediately. Joost proposes that any annex starting with '0' should be considered free-form, meaning it can be used without any additional restrictions.\n\nThere are several benefits to this approach. First, it allows developers to utilize the taproot annex for a variety of applications right away, without having to wait for a structured format like TLV. Second, it keeps the options open for future developments and improvements in structure. By not setting the structure in stone too early, it ensures that we can adapt to new standards as they emerge.\n\nAdditionally, using a non-structured format may require fewer bytes compared to a structured format like TLV. This can improve efficiency, especially when dealing with small amounts of data.\n\nTo summarize, Joost believes that adopting this free-form approach for the taproot annex will immediately expand its usage while allowing for possible transition to a more structured format in the future. This approach is seen as practical and efficient, offering benefits in both the short and long term.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps! Let me know if you have further questions.",

      "summary": "In this message, the sender presents an idea called out-of-band relay as an alternative method for transmitting transaction packages to miners while peer-to-peer package relay is still being developed. The sender emphasizes that they do not necessarily support this idea but believe it is worth mentioning for further discussion.\n\nThe sender starts by describing a hypothetical scenario where there are two transactions: transaction A (e.g., a lightning commitment transaction) with a fee rate of 0 sat/b, and transaction B which needs a fee bump. Currently, these transactions cannot reach miners due to the lack of a proper relay mechanism.\n\nTo solve this problem, the sender proposes introducing a third transaction, transaction C. Transaction C would contain the raw transactions A and B as a taproot annex. Alternatively, a commit/reveal style inscription could be used, but the sender believes it would be more complicated and less efficient.\n\nTo ensure the propagation of transaction C, it would need to have sufficient fees. Additionally, transaction C would need to use at least one of the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B but not any inputs from transaction A.\n\nMiners, upon receiving transaction C, could detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. This transaction package, consisting of both A and B, would then replace transaction C and could be included in a block for mining.\n\nTo make the combined package of A and B more attractive to miners than transaction C, the extra weight of the embedded transactions in C can help. It is important to note that the fees for transaction C would never be paid because it has been replaced. Therefore, there would be no additional costs associated with using this package relay scheme unless the weight of A and B is very low and B needs to pay a higher fee rate to ensure the replacement of C.\n\nIf not all miners adopt this incentive-compatible replacement, there is a chance that transaction C may still be mined. However, this is less probable if the fee rate for C is kept to a minimum. In case transaction C is mined, the sender suggests retrying the operation with a modified B and C, though the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.\n\nThe message concludes with the sender's name, Joost.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this explanation, we will discuss a proposal called \"out-of-band relay\" that aims to solve the problem of getting transaction packages to miners in a more efficient way while peer-to-peer (p2p) package relay is still being developed. \n\nTo understand this proposal, let's consider a scenario where there are two transactions: A, which is a parent transaction that pays 0 sat/b (e.g., a lightning commitment transaction), and B, which is a fee bumping child transaction. Currently, these transactions cannot reach miners, meaning they cannot be included in blocks and added to the blockchain.\n\nThe workaround suggested in this proposal involves introducing a third transaction, called C. Transaction C is specifically crafted to contain the raw transactions A and B in a taproot annex. An alternative could be a commit/reveal style inscription, but it is considered more complicated and less efficient.\n\nTo ensure the propagation of transaction C, it would need to pay sufficient fees. Additionally, it would use at least one of the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B, but it would not include any inputs from transaction A. The reason for using the same inputs as transaction B is to make sure that the package is more attractive to miners than just transaction C alone.\n\nWhen miners receive transaction C, they can detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. This transaction package, which includes both A and B, would then replace transaction C and can be included in a block for mining.\n\nIt's important to note that the combined package of A+B should offer more attractive incentives for miners than just transaction C.

To reduce the likelihood of this happening, it is recommended to keep the fee rate for C to a minimum. If transaction C is indeed mined, the process can be retried with a modified version of B and C, although the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.\n\nIn summary, this proposal suggests using a third transaction (C) that contains the raw transactions A and B in an annex or inscription. Transaction C would be sent to miners with sufficient fees and using the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B. Miners would detect the embedded transactions A and B and replace C with the A+B package, which can then be included in a block for mining.",

      "summary": "The text you provided appears to be a proposal for a new feature called Silent Payments for Bitcoin. The proposal aims to address privacy concerns and improve the efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe overview of the proposal states that using a new address for each Bitcoin transaction is important for maintaining privacy. However, this often requires secure interaction between the sender and receiver, which is not always feasible or desirable. To solve this problem, protocols have been proposed that use a static payment address and notifications sent via the blockchain. These protocols eliminate the need for interaction but have drawbacks such as increased costs and potential metadata exposure.\n\nThe Silent Payments proposal aims to address these limitations by introducing a solution that eliminates the need for interaction and notifications while protecting both sender and receiver privacy. However, this solution requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which may be challenging for light clients.\n\nThe proposal outlines several goals that the protocol aims to achieve. These goals include no increase in transaction size or cost, transactions blending in with other Bitcoin transactions, transactions not being linked to a silent payment address, no sender-receiver interaction required, no linking of multiple payments to the same sender, avoiding accidental address reuse, supporting payment labeling, using existing backup and recovery methods, separating scanning and spending responsibilities, being compatible with other spending protocols like CoinJoin, supporting light client/SPV wallets, and being upgradeable.\n\nThe proposal provides an overview of the protocol, explaining how it works in a simple case scenario. In this scenario, Bob publishes a public key as a silent payment address, and Alice, the sender, creates a destination output using a private key and public key. The destination output is encoded as a BIP341 taproot output. Bob scans for payments using his private key, and once he detects a payment, he checks for additional outputs as well.\n\nThe proposal also covers scenarios for creating more than one output, preventing address reuse, using all inputs in a transaction, and managing spend and scan keys. It suggests using labels to differentiate incoming payments for a single silent payment address, as well as using labels for managing change outputs.\n\nOverall, the proposal provides a detailed explanation of the Silent Payments protocol and its various aspects. It includes technical details and examples to illustrate how the protocol works.",
      "summaryeli15": "Silent Payments is a new proposal that addresses the issue of maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions. In order to keep transactions private, it is important to use a different address for each transaction. However, this usually requires the sender and receiver to interact to generate a new address for each transaction, which can be difficult and undesirable.\n\nTo solve this issue, various protocols have been proposed that use a static payment address and notifications sent via the blockchain. These protocols eliminate the need for interaction but come with their own set of problems, such as increased costs for one-time payments and potential revealing of sender and receiver metadata.\n\nThe Silent Payments proposal aims to address the limitations of these existing approaches by presenting a solution that eliminates the need for interaction, eliminates the need for notifications, and protects the privacy of both the sender and receiver. However, this comes with the requirement for wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which is feasible for full nodes but poses a challenge for light clients. Light client support is an area of ongoing research.\n\nThe goals of Silent Payments are as follows:\n1. No increase in the size or cost of transactions.\n2. Transactions should blend in with other Bitcoin transactions and not be distinguishable.\n3. Transactions should not be linked to a silent payment address by an outside observer.\n4. No interaction is required between the sender and receiver.\n5. Multiple payments from the same sender should not be linked.\n6. Each silent payment should go to a unique address to avoid address reuse.\n7. Support for payment labeling.\n8. Use of existing seed phrase or descriptor methods for backup and recovery.\n9. Separation of scanning and spending responsibilities.\n10. Compatibility with other spending protocols, such as CoinJoin.\n11. Light client/SPV wallet support.\n12. The protocol should be upgradeable.\n\nThe protocol begins with a simple case where Bob publishes a public key B as a silent payment address. Alice, the sender, discovers Bob's address and selects a UTXO (unspent transaction output) with a private key a and a corresponding public key A. Alice then creates a destination output P for Bob using a hash and encryption process. Bob, the receiver, scans the blockchain using his private key b to find transactions with unspent taproot outputs and perform an encryption calculation to find the destination output P.\n\nTo create more than one output for Bob, Alice includes an integer in the hash and encryption process. Bob can detect these additional outputs by searching for the original output and checking for subsequent outputs. This scanning requirement for Bob is minimal.\n\nTo prevent address reuse, Alice includes a hash of the previous transaction's outpoint in the encryption process. Bob must include the same hash when scanning.\n\nFor transactions with multiple inputs, Alice can perform the encryption process using the sum of the input public keys. This reduces Bob's scanning requirement and allows for light client support.\n\nTo check for incoming payments, Bob needs his private key b. To minimize risks, Bob can publish an address with a scanning key Bscan and a spending key Bspend. The scanning is done with the public key Bscan, and spending is done with the private key bspend.\n\nFor differentiating incoming payments, Bob can label his spend public key Bspend with an integer m. Alice can perform the encryption process using one of the labeled pairs (Bscan, Bm), and Bob can detect the labeled payment by checking if the remainder matches any of the labels that the wallet has previously used.\n\nTo manage his own change outputs, Bob can use labels as well. He can reserve a secret change label and use it to create a change output for himself in the encryption process. This allows Bob to know which of his unspent outputs were change when recovering his wallet.\n\nOverall, Silent Payments provides a solution for maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions without requiring interaction between the sender and receiver. It introduces a new protocol that eliminates the need for notifications and protects both parties' privacy. However, it does require wallets to scan the blockchain, which may be challenging for light clients.",

      "summary": "In this message, ThomasV proposes an extension to BOLT-11, which is a Lightning Network protocol, to allow for invoices with two bundled payments. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the use case of services that require a prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels.\n\nSubmarine swaps and JIT channels involve the service provider receiving a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage. They have to send funds on-chain and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. However, there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, which creates a need for the service providers to ask for prepayment of mining fees.\n\nThomasV points out that services like Loop by Lightning Labs, which utilize dedicated client software, can ask for prepayment because their software can handle it. However, competitors like Boltz exchange, which do not require a dedicated wallet, cannot easily implement this prepayment requirement. This vulnerability puts Boltz at risk of denial of service (DoS) attacks where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees.\n\nIn the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against mining fee attacks need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. However, this makes the service provider a custodian, which may subject them to legal regulations like the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from this game.\n\nTo address these issues, ThomasV proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The proposed semantics of bundled payments are as follows: the invoice contains two preimages and two amounts (prepayment and main payment). The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the prepayment with a MPP (multi-path payment) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts the on-chain transaction. It is noted that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage.\n\nThomasV acknowledges that this proposal does not prevent the service provider from stealing the prepayment, but that is already a risk in the current system. The proposal aims to level the playing field for competition between lightning service providers. Currently, using Loop requires a dedicated client, and competitors without an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack. ACINQ is mentioned as a potential beneficiary of this proposal, as it would make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian and potentially alleviate concerns about European regulations.\n\nLastly, ThomasV suggests that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be done in a non-interactive way, avoiding unnecessary complications.\n\nOverall, the proposal aims to address the specific use case of prepayment for mining fees in light of non-custodian exchanges and suggests modifications to BOLT-11 to accommodate this functionality.",
      "summaryeli15": "Good morning, ThomasV!\n\nIt seems you are proposing an extension to BOLT-11, which is a protocol for Lightning Network payment requests. Specifically, you want to allow an invoice to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. Let's break down the use case you presented.\n\nThe scenario you mentioned involves services that require the prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place. Two examples of such services are submarine swaps and JIT (Just-in-Time) channels. In both cases, the service provider receives a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage. They are then required to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Since there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, service providers need to ask for prepayment of mining fees. In the case of submarine swaps, services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for a prepayment because their software can handle it. This is referred to as a \"no show penalty\" on the Loop website. But competitors who require a dedicated wallet, such as the Boltz exchange, cannot do the same.\n\nThis creates a vulnerability for Boltz, as they can be subjected to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where the attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees. In the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves from this mining fee attack often require the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. Phoenix may be an example of such a service, although their pay-to-open service is not open-source. However, this approach makes the service custodial, which can have legal implications within the European MICA regulation.\n\nTo address these issues, you propose bundling the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The basic idea is as follows:\n\n1. The BOLT-11 invoice would contain two preimages and two amounts: one for the prepayment and one for the main payment.\n2. The receiver (service provider) should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the prepayment with a Multi-Path Payment (MPP) timeout.\n3. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. It is important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this proposal does not prevent a service provider from stealing the prepayment, but that is already a risk in the current system. The objective is to level the playing field in terms of competition between Lightning service providers. Currently, using Loop requires a dedicated client, and competitors without an established user base running such a client are exposed to the mining fee attack.\n\nYou also believe that ACINQ, a Lightning Network developer, would benefit from this proposal as it would allow them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodial. As it stands, their pay-to-open service used by Phoenix may fall within the scope of the European MICA regulation, which could be a significant concern for them.\n\nLastly, you believe that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. Your reasoning is that the proposal does not require the exchange of new messages, and it can be done in a non-interactive way. You aim to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary complications.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation clarifies your proposal. Let me know if you have any further questions!",

      "summary": "The information provided describes a Pull Request (PR) in the Bitcoin Core software repository. The PR addresses an issue related to transaction states and conflicts within the wallet.\n\n- The PR branch HEAD (current commit) is identified as \"0538ad7\" at the time of the review club meeting.\n- In Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a transaction state, which determines how the wallet handles the transaction. The transaction state affects whether a user can spend the transaction, and whether it is included in the user's balance.\n- Wallet transaction states and conflicts were previously discussed in review club #27145, which likely refers to a previous review or discussion session for a related PR or topic.\n- On the master branch of the software, wallet transactions were only considered conflicted when the conflicting transaction was mined into a block. If a transaction was only conflicted by a transaction in the mempool (unconfirmed transactions), it was considered as TxStateInactive instead. This sometimes caused confusion for users because their funds would temporarily appear to \"disappear\".\n- The PR aims to address this confusion by treating transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. It introduces another transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted and keeps track of conflicting transactions in a map called MempoolConflicts. This map associates a wallet transaction's hash with a set of hashes of its conflicting transactions in the mempool.\n- The request for review asks whether the PR has been reviewed and provides options for the review approach: Concept ACK (conceptually approved), Approach ACK (approved approach), Tested ACK (tested and approved), or NACK (not approved).\n- The PR is fixing a bug. The bug or issue is the confusion caused by transactions with conflicts in the mempool being considered inactive instead of conflicted.\n- The trade-off with considering mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted rather than inactive is that it may provide clearer visibility to users regarding the state of their transactions. However, it may also introduce additional complexity in managing conflicting transactions, as well as potential performance implications.\n- The first commit is necessary for this PR, although without the specific details of the commit, it's challenging to determine its exact purpose. The commit might change existing behavior related to transaction state handling.\n- The purpose of adding a MempoolConflicts map is to keep track of conflicting transactions in the mempool for a specific wallet transaction. The wallet cannot solely rely on mapTxSpends (presumably another map or structure) to check for conflicts because it may not have complete information on mempool conflicts.\n- The benefit of adding TxStateMempoolConflicted as its own transaction state instead of using TxStateConflicted is to distinguish between conflicts caused by transactions in the mempool and conflicts caused by mined transactions. By having separate states, the wallet can handle them differently if needed, depending on the specific requirements or behavior desired.\n- With this PR, a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. The exact implementation details would need to be reviewed to determine the specific steps or actions required by the user to do so.\n- After a wallet is reloaded, the previously mempool-conflicted transaction will likely retain its TxStateMempoolConflicted state unless it has been mined or resolved in some way during the reload process.\n- It is unclear without more context whether the tests added to wallet_conflicts.py fail on the master branch. This would require the specific testing setup and environment to determine.\n- This PR may not directly modify the balance calculation code, but it potentially affects the balance calculation of the wallet by introducing a new transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) that needs to be accounted for.\n- TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions may or may not be treated the same in memory. The exact implementation details within the PR would determine if they are treated differently or not.\n- There is no mention of additional test cases that need to be implemented, but it does not rule out the possibility that there might be additional test cases that could be useful.\n- The modification of wallet_abandonconflict.py in the second commit is necessary to update the functionality of that particular script to align with the changes introduced in this PR. The exact details would require a review of the specific modifications made in the commit.",
      "summaryeli15": "This statement is referring to a pull request (PR) in the Bitcoin Core software. A PR is a way for developers to propose changes to the codebase. In this specific PR, the change involves how wallet transactions are handled when conflicts occur.\n\nIn Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a state, which determines how the wallet treats and counts the transaction. This state is important for determining which transactions can be spent by the user and which transactions contribute to the user's balance.\n\nThis particular PR addresses the issue of conflicts in wallet transactions. Conflicts occur when there are multiple transactions that spend the same inputs. The PR introduces a new transaction state called \"mempool-conflicted\" for transactions that have conflicts with transactions in the mempool (a pool of unconfirmed transactions).\n\nPreviously, in the master branch of the software, transactions were only considered conflicted when the conflicting transaction was mined into a block. This means that if a transaction had a conflict with a mempool transaction, it would be considered as inactive instead of conflicted. This could be confusing for users because it would seem like their funds briefly disappear.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the PR treats transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. It introduces the new transaction state \"mempool-conflicted\" and keeps track of the conflicting transactions in a map called MempoolConflicts. This map stores the wallet transaction hashes and their corresponding mempool conflict transaction hashes.\n\nThe first commit in the PR is necessary for the changes made in this PR. It introduces the new transaction state and modifies the transaction handling logic. This change does not impact any existing behavior since it is a new feature.\n\nThe MempoolConflicts map is added to provide a way for the wallet to check for conflicts in mempool transactions. The wallet cannot solely rely on the mapTxSpends function to check for conflicts because it only checks for conflicts with transactions already in the blockchain, not in the mempool.\n\nThe benefit of adding a separate transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of using the existing \"TxStateConflicted\" is to differentiate between conflicts in the mempool and conflicts that are already confirmed in a block. This allows for more precise tracking and handling of conflicts.\n\nWith this PR, a user will be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. The changes made in this PR enable the wallet to properly handle the abandonment process for these conflicted transactions.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, a previously mempool-conflicted transaction will still be in the \"mempool-conflicted\" state.\n\nThe tests added to wallet_conflicts.py may fail on the master branch, depending on the specific circumstances and scenarios being tested.\n\nEven though this PR doesn't directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made in this PR do affect the balance calculation of the wallet. By properly handling mempool-conflicted transactions and considering them as conflicted, the balance calculation will accurately reflect the user's available funds.\n\nTxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not treated the same way in memory. They are separate transaction states, and the changes made in this PR ensure that they are properly distinguished and handled.\n\nThere may be additional test cases that could be implemented to further validate the changes made in this PR, but those specific test cases are not mentioned in this statement.\n\nThe wallet_abandonconflict.py script needs to be modified in the second commit because this script is responsible for handling conflicts and abandoning transactions. The changes made in this PR affect how conflicts are identified and managed, so the script needs to be updated to align with the new logic.",

      "summary": "The given statement is referring to a software development project and the changes made in a particular branch regarding memory usage. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. The PR branch HEAD: The initial statement specifies that the branch HEAD (the latest commit) has the unique identifier 'd25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487'. This identifier is used to track changes in the project.\n\n2. PR 25325: It mentions that the current PR is a follow-on to PR 25325, which was reviewed on March 8 of this year. It suggests reviewing the notes from PR 25325 in order to understand the context and changes made.\n\n3. -dbcache configuration option: The -dbcache is a configuration option in Bitcoin Core, a software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It determines the amount of memory allocated for the coin cache and other database-related memory uses. The default value is 450 MiB. The function CalculateCacheSizes() is responsible for calculating the optimal cache size.\n\n4. Coins Cache Hit Ratio: It discusses the coins cache hit ratio, which is the fraction of lookup operations that find the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) in the cache. Using less memory than allowed decreases this hit ratio, while using more memory than specified risks crashing the bitcoind software on memory-restricted systems.\n\n5. Accurate Accounting of Memory: The statement emphasizes the importance of accurately accounting for memory usage in the cache. Although it doesn't have to be perfect, it should be fairly close to avoid any issues.\n\n6. Logical Memory vs Physical Memory: When a program requests a certain amount of dynamic memory (X bytes), the C++ runtime library internally allocates slightly more memory for the memory allocator's metadata (overhead). Logical memory is the requested amount, while physical memory accounts for the metadata overhead.\n\n7. MallocUsage() and memusage.h: Bitcoin Core provides a function called MallocUsage() in the memusage.h file. This function approximates the conversion from logical memory size to physical size. It takes an allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size. Several overloads of the DynamicUsage() function exist in memusage.h for different data types, which utilize MallocUsage().\n\n8. PR #25325 and DynamicUsage(): PR #25325 introduced a pool memory resource and added a new DynamicUsage() overload specifically for computing the overall coins cache size. This is necessary to ensure the cache stays within the configured cache size.\n\n9. Review of the PR: The statement asks if the PR has been reviewed and what the review approach was. The options include Concept ACK (agreement with the overall concept), Approach ACK (agreement with the implementation approach), Tested ACK (confirming the changes have been tested), or NACK (disagreement or negative review).\n\n10. Templated Arguments in DynamicUsage(): The statement raises a question about why the DynamicUsage() overload on line 170 in the master branch has many templated arguments compared to the overload below it. This suggests a comparison to understand the differences and reasons behind the choices.\n\n11. DynamicUsage() in the master branch: It queries how the DynamicUsage() overload in the master branch works. Specifically, it asks about the values being added together in the PR under review.\n\n12. m.bucket_count() in DynamicUsage() calculation: The question raised is about why the m.bucket_count() is part of the DynamicUsage() calculation and why it is not already accounted for in the resource \"chunks.\" This implies a need to understand the justification for including this additional value.\n\n13. DynamicUsage() calculation in the PR: The statement notes that in this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location, and m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. It asks why this change was made and what advantage there is in not referencing m.bucket_count() anymore.\n\n14. Extra Credit: Finally, there is an additional question regarding \"cachedCoinsUsage\" and its addition to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(). This question requires an explanation of cachedCoinsUsage and its purpose in relation to memory usage calculation.\n\nIn summary, the statement provides detailed information about the PR, the importance of memory accounting, the changes made in the dynamic memory usage calculation, and asks various questions to further explore the modifications and understand the reasoning behind them.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this context, PR stands for \"Pull Request,\" which is a way for developers to propose changes to a codebase. The PR branch HEAD refers to the specific version of the code that was being reviewed at the time of a review club meeting.\n\nThe PR being discussed is a follow-on to PR 25325, which was reviewed on March 8th of this year. The person speaking is suggesting that the reviewer should look at the notes from that previous review.\n\nThe -dbcache configuration option determines the amount of memory used for the coins cache and other uses of memory in the database. By default, it is set to 450 MiB. The coins cache hit ratio represents the fraction of lookups that find the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) in the cache. If you use less memory than allowed, the cache hit ratio decreases. Conversely, using more memory than specified can lead to crashes on memory-restricted systems.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of memory usage, an accounting of the cache's memory usage is important. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be reasonably close. However, when a program requests a certain amount of memory, the C++ runtime library internally allocates slightly more for the memory allocator's metadata, or overhead. This means that logical memory, which is the requested memory size, is not the same as physical memory, which includes the metadata.\n\nThe memory allocator metadata is complex and depends on factors such as the machine architecture and memory model. Unfortunately, there is no library function that directly converts logical memory size to physical size. To solve this problem, Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage(), which approximates this conversion. It takes an allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size.\n\nThe source file memusage.h contains many overloads of the function DynamicUsage(), which are used for different data types that may be allocated in the system. These overloads make use of MallocUsage(). In PR #25325, a new DynamicUsage() overload is added for the pool memory resource, which calculates the overall coins cache size. This allows the code to stay within the configured cache size.\n\nThis DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource is only called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(). \n\nThe question then asks if the reviewer has reviewed the PR and what their approach was (Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK). \n\nMoving on, the question asks about the DynamicUsage() overload in the master branch, which refers to the codebase without the PR. The overload in question has many templated arguments compared to the overload immediately above it (on line 170). The reason for this is not explicitly mentioned in the given text.\n\nThe text then asks how this DynamicUsage() overload worked on the master branch. It also inquires about the various values being added together in this PR. Unfortunately, the specific values being added are not described in the provided text.\n\nNext, the question asks why m.bucket_count() is part of the DynamicUsage() calculation and why the memory for the bucket allocation is not already accounted for in the resource \"chunks\". However, an explanation for these questions is not provided.\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location, but the exact location is not given. Furthermore, it is stated that m.bucket_count() is no longer needed, but the reason for its removal is not explained. The advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() is also not specified.\n\nFinally, there is an extra credit question asking about cachedCoinsUsage and why CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() adds it to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()). Unfortunately, no information about cachedCoinsUsage or why it is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) is provided.",

      "summary": "The text is providing an explanation about a pull request (PR) that involves the modification of a branch called HEAD in the PR branch. At the time of the review club meeting, the specific commit of the PR branch HEAD was faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4.\n\nIn the current system, there is a data structure called mapRelay, which is a map that stores all the transactions that have been relayed (sent) to any peer recently. Alongside mapRelay, there is another data structure called g_relay_expiration, which is a sorted list containing the expiration times for the entries in mapRelay. The entries in both mapRelay and g_relay_expiration are retained for a duration of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer requests a transaction by sending a getdata message, but that particular transaction is no longer available in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), it can be retrieved from mapRelay.\n\nmapRelay has existed since the initial commit in the project's GitHub repository and has been very important. However, over time, its significance has decreased due to various enhancements. For example, Bitcoin Core now prioritizes fetching transactions directly from the mempool. Although there were reasons for not removing mapRelay earlier, most of those reasons have become irrelevant due to improvements made in other areas.\n\nThe proposed PR aims to remove mapRelay and replace it with a new data structure called m_most_recent_block_txs. This new structure will only keep track of the transactions from the most recent block.\n\nRegarding reviewing the PR, the specific approach taken is not mentioned in the provided text. It asks whether the PR was reviewed with a Concept ACK (conceptually sound), Approach ACK (implementation approach approved), Tested ACK (reviewer personally tested the changes), or NACK (any of the previous ACKs can't be given). The response to this question is not provided.\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because it involves dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. The hint suggests referring to a comment for more information on this aspect.\n\nThe introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves a problem by replacing mapRelay, which has become less relevant over time. Instead of maintaining all the relayed transactions, the focus is narrowed down to only the transactions from the most recent block. It is necessary to introduce this replacement, as it allows for a more streamlined and efficient approach.\n\nIn terms of memory requirements, m_most_recent_block_txs should generally require less memory compared to mapRelay. This decrease in memory usage is because mapRelay stores all transactions relayed to any peer recently, while m_most_recent_block_txs only keeps track of the transactions from the most recent block.\n\nAs a result of this change, there can be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time than before. This is because mapRelay retains transactions for 15 minutes, whereas m_most_recent_block_txs only includes transactions from the most recent block. If a transaction is not included in the most recent block, it will no longer be available through m_most_recent_block_txs.\n\nRegarding other possible downsides of removing mapRelay, they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, any additional downsides would require further consideration and analysis based on the specific requirements and dependencies of the system.",
      "summaryeli15": "At the time of this review club meeting, the PR branch HEAD (the latest commit in the PR branch) had the identifier \"faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4\".\n\nIn the Bitcoin Core codebase, there is a data structure called mapRelay, which is a map that contains all transactions that have been relayed (shared with other peers) recently. It is accompanied by another data structure called g_relay_expiration, which is a sorted list of expiration times for entries in mapRelay. Entries stay in mapRelay and g_relay_expiration for a maximum of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer requests a transaction by sending a getdata message, but that transaction is no longer in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), it can be served from mapRelay. So, mapRelay acts as a cache for previously relayed transactions.\n\nmapRelay has been present in the Bitcoin Core codebase for a long time, even in the first GitHub commit. Initially, it was crucial for the functioning of the system. However, its importance has diminished over time. For instance, Bitcoin Core now attempts to directly fetch transactions from the mempool before checking mapRelay. There have been other reasons why mapRelay hasn't been removed earlier, but most of those reasons are no longer valid due to other improvements in the codebase.\n\nThis PR (Pull Request) aims to remove mapRelay entirely and introduce a new data structure called m_most_recent_block_txs. The purpose of m_most_recent_block_txs is to keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block. By doing this, the new data structure solves the problem that was previously handled by mapRelay.\n\nWhether it is necessary to introduce m_most_recent_block_txs instead of just removing mapRelay without any replacement depends on the specific requirements and design decisions made by the developers. In this case, the introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs appears to be necessary to ensure the continued functioning of the system.\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because its size can vary dynamically based on the number of transactions relayed and the expiration times of those transactions. The comment mentioned in the question might provide more insight into the complexities of accurately estimating the memory usage.\n\nThe memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs compared to mapRelay are not explicitly stated in the given excerpt. It would require further investigation into the PR or the relevant code changes to determine the specific memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs.\n\nAs a result of this change, there might be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time than before. Since mapRelay had a fixed expiration time of 15 minutes, any transactions that entered mapRelay would be available for at least that duration. However, with the introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs, the availability of transactions may be tied to the lifespan of the most recent block. If a new block is mined within 15 minutes, transactions from the previous block may no longer be available through m_most_recent_block_txs.\n\nOther possible downsides of removing mapRelay may include:\n\n1. Increased reliance on the mempool: With mapRelay gone, there could be more frequent requests to the mempool for transactions that are no longer available through mapRelay. This could increase the load on the mempool and potentially affect the performance of the system.\n\n2. Reduced caching of relayed transactions: Since mapRelay is a cache of relayed transactions, removing it means losing the ability to quickly serve previously relayed transactions. Depending on the frequency and importance of such requests, this could negatively impact the efficiency of relaying transactions to peers.\n\nIt's important to note that to fully understand the implications and benefits of this PR, a thorough review of the entire code changes and discussion is required.",

      "summary": "Sure, I can explain in great detail.\n\nThe information you provided is about a Pull Request (PR) in the libbitcoinkernel project. This project aims to separate the consensus engine of Bitcoin Core from other non-consensus modules in the codebase.\n\nThe HEAD of the PR branch at the time of this review club meeting was a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5. This is just a unique identifier for the specific commit in the PR branch.\n\nThe PR #27636 introduced a new interface called kernel::Notifications. This interface is meant to be implemented by different node implementations (such as KernelNotifications) to handle specific events and trigger desired behaviors.\n\nOne of the events that this PR #27711 focuses on is when the consensus engine requires a shutdown, either expectedly or unexpectedly. To handle this event, two new methods are added to the kernel::Notifications interface, namely kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods allow the node to implement the necessary shutdown behavior.\n\nAdditionally, this PR also moves the shutdown files and the remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code. This was started in PR #27636. This move helps decouple most of the non-consensus code from the libbitcoinkernel, further enhancing the separation of concerns.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the question \"Did you review the PR?\" suggests checking if the person reviewing the PR conceptually approved the changes (Concept ACK), agreed with the approach taken (Approach ACK), verified the changes by testing (Tested ACK), or did not approve the changes (NACK). The specific response to this question is not provided in the given information.\n\nNow let's address the questions you asked:\n\n1. \"Why do we have startShutdown both in kernel/notifications_interface.h as well as in node/kernel_notifications.h?\"\n\nIt seems like there might be a duplication or overlap between the startShutdown method in the kernel/notifications_interface.h file and the node/kernel_notifications.h file. Without further context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It could be a mistake or a design decision that was made for specific reasons.\n\n2. \"How does fRequestShutdown relate to this PR, and can you elaborate on its role in terminating long-running kernel functions?\"\n\nThe given information does not directly mention fRequestShutdown. Without more context, it is challenging to provide a specific answer regarding its relation to the PR or its role in terminating long-running kernel functions. fRequestShutdown might be a variable or a flag used somewhere in the codebase for handling shutdown requests, but we cannot determine its exact role based on the provided information.\n\n3. \"How does the notification interface contribute to the decoupling of most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel?\"\n\nThe notification interface, represented by kernel::Notifications, helps in decoupling the non-consensus code from the libbitcoinkernel by providing a separate interface for handling events and triggering specific behaviors. By implementing this interface, different node implementations can handle events in their own way without tightly coupling them to the libbitcoinkernel's consensus engine. This separation improves modularity and allows different parts of the codebase to evolve independently.\n\n4. \"Can you describe the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications in this new setup? Who are the producers and consumers of these notifications?\"\n\nWithout further details, it is challenging to describe the exact flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications. However, based on the information provided, the producers of these notifications would be the consensus engine or any other component that determines the need for shutdown or encounters a fatal error. The consumers would be the node implementations that implement the kernel::Notifications interface. These implementations would provide the necessary logic and behavior when these notifications are received.\n\n5. \"Are there any potential race conditions or synchronization issues that might arise with the use of the notification interface in this context?\"\n\nGiven the limited information provided, it is difficult to identify specific race conditions or synchronization issues related to the use of the notification interface in this context. However, whenever multiple components interact and exchange notifications, there is always a possibility of race conditions or synchronization issues if proper care is not taken to handle concurrent access and ensure consistency. It is crucial to review the code implementation carefully and consider any potential race conditions or synchronization requirements.\n\n6. \"Why is KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested a reference value? Do you have any ideas for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown?\"\n\nBased on the given information, KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested seems to be a member variable in the KernelNotifications class. It is described as a reference value. Without further context, it is challenging to provide a specific reason for this design choice. Using a reference value could be a way to allow different parts of the code to share and access the same flag indicating a shutdown request. Alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown could involve using a different type of flag or a notification mechanism to communicate the shutdown request across different components.",

This separation allows for more flexibility and modularity in the code.\n\nIn previous discussions, the PRs #25527, #24410, and #20158 have been covered, which are all related to the libbitcoinkernel project.\n\nNow, let's talk about PR #27636. This PR introduces a new interface called kernel::Notifications. This interface can be implemented by node implementations, like KernelNotifications, to trigger certain behaviors for specific events. One such event is when the consensus engine requires a shutdown, either expectedly or unexpectedly.\n\nTo facilitate the necessary behavior for these events, PR #27711 is introduced. This PR adds two new notification methods to the kernel::Notifications interface: kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods allow the node to implement the required behavior when a shutdown or a fatal error occurs.\n\nAdditionally, this PR also moves the shutdown files and other usages of the uiInterface out of the kernel code, as started in PR #27636.\n\nNow, moving on to the questions:\n\n1. The question asks if the PR has been reviewed and to provide a review approach. The possible responses to this question are Concept ACK (acknowledgment), Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK (negative acknowledgment). The reviewer needs to specify their review approach.\n\n2. The question asks why there is a startShutdown method in both kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h. Without further context, it is difficult to provide a specific answer. It could be that these methods serve different purposes or have separate implementations in different parts of the code.\n\n3. The question asks about the fRequestShutdown and its role in terminating long-running kernel functions. Without further context or code reference, it is challenging to provide a specific answer. However, generally speaking, fRequestShutdown could be a flag or variable that is set to indicate the need for a shutdown in long-running kernel functions.\n\n4. The question asks how the notification interface contributes to the decoupling of non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel. The notification interface allows the node implementation to handle specific events or behaviors independently from the consensus engine. By using this interface, the non-consensus code can be separated and decoupled from the libbitcoinkernel, improving modularity and flexibility of the codebase.\n\n5. The question asks for a description of the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications in this new setup. The producers of these notifications could be different parts of the code that trigger events like a shutdown or a fatal error. The consumers of these notifications are the implementations of the kernel::Notifications interface, which handle the specific behaviors for these events.\n\n6. The question asks if there could be any potential race conditions or synchronization issues with the use of the notification interface in this context. Without analyzing the specific implementation and codebase, it is difficult to determine if there could be potential race conditions or synchronization issues. However, using proper synchronization mechanisms and careful implementation can help prevent such issues.\n\n7. The question asks why the KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested is a reference value. Without further context or code reference, it is challenging to provide a specific answer. However, having a reference value could be useful for efficient memory usage or for maintaining a single shared state that can be accessed and modified by multiple parts of the code.\n\n8. The question asks for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown. Without further context or code reference, it is difficult to provide specific alternative approaches. However, some potential alternatives could include using flags, signals, or callbacks to indicate the need for a shutdown. The choice of approach would depend on the specific requirements and design considerations of the codebase.",

      "summary": "In this week's newsletter, several topics are discussed in detail. Firstly, there is a proposal to extend BOLT11 invoices to allow for two separate payments. Thomas Voegtlin suggests that these invoices should have the option to request two payments, each with a separate secret and amount. This could be useful for submarine swaps and JIT channels. However, there is a concern that if the user does not disclose their secret, the service provider will not receive any compensation and will incur onchain costs for no gain. Voegtlin believes that existing JIT channel service providers avoid this problem by requiring the user to disclose their secret before the funding transaction is secure. However, he notes that this may create legal problems and prevent non-custodial wallets from offering a similar service. To solve this issue, Voegtlin suggests allowing a BOLT11 invoice to contain two separate commitments to secrets, each for a different amount. One secret and amount would be used for an upfront fee to pay the onchain transaction costs, while the other secret and amount would be used for the actual submarine swap or JIT channel funding. This proposal has received several comments, with different opinions on its practicality and feasibility.\n\nThe second topic discussed in the newsletter is a limited weekly series about mempool policy. It explains the policies related to transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. The newsletter provides an example scenario where each node operator chooses a random nVersion and only accepts transactions with that nVersion. This would result in incompatible policies between nodes, leading to a failure in transaction propagation to miners. On the other hand, having identical policies across the network helps converge mempool contents and allows for smooth transaction relay, fee estimation, and compact block relay.\n\nThe newsletter also highlights updates to Bitcoin wallets and services. It mentions that Greenlight has open-sourced its libraries for client and language bindings, as well as a testing framework guide. Tapsim, a script execution debugging and visualization tool for tapscript using btcd, is introduced. Bitcoin Keeper 1.0.4 is announced, which is a mobile wallet supporting multisig, hardware signers, BIP85, and coinjoin support using the Whirlpool protocol. EttaWallet, a Lightning wallet with a focus on usability, is also announced. BTC Warp, a light client sync proof-of-concept using zkSNARKs to verify a chain of Bitcoin block headers, is introduced. Additionally, lnprototest v0.0.4, a test suite for LN, is released.\n\nLastly, the newsletter provides information about new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects. It encourages users to upgrade to new releases or help test release candidates. The notable changes mentioned include the addition of support for replying to onion messages in LDK, bringing LDK closer to full support for offers. It also mentions the addition of support for keysend payments that use simplified multipath payments in LDK. Previously, LDK supported both technologies separately, but not when used together. The changes made in this release aim to mitigate any potential problems.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers various topics related to extending BOLT11 invoices, mempool policy, updates to Bitcoin wallets and services, and new releases in the Bitcoin infrastructure software ecosystem.",
      "summaryeli15": "This week's newsletter discusses several topics related to Bitcoin technology and infrastructure. \n\nFirst, there is a proposal to extend BOLT11 invoices, which are used in the Lightning Network, to allow for requesting two separate payments. Currently, BOLT11 invoices contain one payment amount and secret, but the proposal suggests adding a second set of payment amount and secret. This could be useful for things like submarine swaps and JIT (Just-in-Time) channels. \n\nIn a submarine swap, funds are exchanged on-chain for Lightning Network funds, while JIT channels are a type of Lightning Network channel that is only funded when needed. However, there is a potential issue where the user may not disclose their secret, resulting in the service provider not receiving compensation and incurring costs for no gain. The proposal suggests that by allowing two separate commitments to secrets and amounts in the invoice, one set could be used for upfront fees and the other for the actual swap or channel funding. \n\nThere have been discussions and different opinions on this proposal. Some argue that it may not be practical to add an additional field to BOLT11 invoices, as not all Lightning Network implementations have updated their support for invoices that don't contain an amount. Others suggest addressing this issue by adding support to offers instead. The discussion is ongoing. \n\nThe newsletter also includes a section about mempool policy, which refers to the rules that determine which transactions are included in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) and ultimately in the next block. It explains that Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than what is allowed by consensus (the rules agreed upon by the majority of nodes in the network). The newsletter discusses the importance of having matching policies across the network to ensure smooth transaction relay and efficient fee estimation. \n\nFurthermore, the newsletter highlights updates to Bitcoin wallets and services. Some notable updates include the open-sourcing of Greenlight libraries, the release of a tapscript debugger called Tapsim, the announcement of Bitcoin Keeper 1.0.4 with new features, the launch of Lightning wallet EttaWallet, and the announcement of a zkSNARK-based block header sync proof-of-concept called BTC Warp.\n\nLastly, the newsletter mentions new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects and encourages readers to consider upgrading or helping to test these releases.\n\nOverall, the newsletter covers various technical discussions and updates related to Bitcoin technology, Lightning Network, and Bitcoin infrastructure projects.",

      "summary": "This week's newsletter discusses various topics related to Bitcoin, including preventing the pinning of coinjoin transactions, mempool policy, and updates on popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.\n\nThe first topic covered in the newsletter is preventing the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Coinjoin is a technique used to improve the privacy and fungibility of Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple transactions into a single transaction. However, a vulnerability known as \"pinning\" allows one participant in a coinjoin transaction to create a conflicting transaction that prevents the original coinjoin transaction from confirming.\n\nGreg Sanders proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new version of transaction relay rules, called v3. Under the proposed rules, coinjoin participants would first spend their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent either by a signature from all participants or by an individual participant after a timelock expires. This means that until the timelock expires, participants must get the other parties or a coordinator to co-sign any conflicting transactions. This reduces the risk of pinning as participants are unlikely to sign conflicting transactions unless it is in their best interest (e.g., a fee bump).\n\nThe authors of the newsletter note that users who would benefit from this construction (e.g., those receiving BTC on another chain) are essentially making a bet that Bitcoin's consensus rules will be changed to support this construction. This might incentivize them to advocate for the change, but it could also lead to other users feeling coerced into accepting the change. At the time of writing, there had been no discussion on the proposal on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list.\n\nThe newsletter also includes a section on mempool policy, which is a set of rules that dictate how transactions are prioritized for inclusion in the mempool (a temporary storage area for unconfirmed transactions) and eventually in the blockchain. The authors explain that Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive mempool policy than what is allowed by consensus rules to protect network resources and ensure scalability, upgradability, and accessibility of full nodes. The newsletter discusses the importance of converging on a single policy and how this helps protect the network's characteristics.\n\nThe Bitcoin Stack Exchange section of the newsletter highlights some of the top-voted questions and answers from the community. The questions cover various topics, such as why Bitcoin nodes accept blocks with excluded transactions, why soft forks restrict the existing ruleset, and why the default Lightning Network channel limit is set to a specific value.\n\nThe newsletter also provides updates on new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure software. Notable changes include Core Lightning adding a new setconfig RPC, Eclair introducing changes to feerate configuration, LND adding the ability to retrieve data from earlier HTLCs, and LDK introducing support for anchor channels and blinded paths.\n\nOverall, the newsletter provides detailed information on preventing coinjoin pinning, mempool policy, community discussions on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, and updates on Bitcoin infrastructure software.",

It was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in the year 2023.\n\nThe paper explores the concept of block propagation in the context of large miners in the field of cryptocurrency mining. Block propagation refers to the process of distributing newly mined blocks across the network so that all participants are aware of the latest transactions and are able to validate them.\n\nThe authors investigate the scenario in which slower block propagation can be more profitable for large miners. This implies that delaying the dissemination of a mined block to the network can yield higher profits for these miners.\n\nThe paper likely discusses the reasons behind this phenomenon and explores the potential economic and strategic implications for large miners.

It was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in 2023. The article discusses the topic of slower block propagation and its profitability for large miners. \n\nBlock propagation refers to the process of transmitting new blocks in a blockchain network. In a blockchain, each block contains a set of transactions that need to be verified and added to the ledger. When a new block is created, it needs to be propagated to other nodes in the network so that they can validate it and add it to their own copy of the blockchain.\n\nIn this article, the authors explore the idea that slower block propagation can be more profitable for large miners in certain scenarios. A miner is a participant in the blockchain network who is responsible for creating new blocks and adding them to the blockchain. Miners compete with each other to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain and earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe authors argue that in some situations, large miners may benefit from intentionally slowing down the propagation of their blocks. This can be counterintuitive, as faster block propagation is generally seen as desirable in blockchain networks. However, the authors provide a theoretical analysis that suggests that under certain conditions, slowing down block propagation can give large miners a competitive advantage.\n\nThe article likely provides more detailed explanations, analyses, and possibly even mathematical models to support their argument.

This attribution is significant as it highlights the tactics and techniques used by the Lazarus Group in their criminal activities.\n\nMotivation Behind Lazarus Group's Attacks:\nThe Lazarus Group is known for its involvement in various high-profile cyberattacks, often with a focus on financial gain. In the case of the Atomic Wallet hack, experts believe that the stolen funds are used to fund North Korea's weapons development program. The Lazarus Group's attacks on cryptocurrency platforms allow them to acquire significant amounts of cryptocurrency, which can then be converted into traditional currencies or used to finance illicit activities. The group's targets and methods demonstrate their commitment to achieving financial goals that support the broader objectives of the North Korean regime.\n\nChallenges in Cashing Out Stolen Assets:\nSuccessfully stealing cryptocurrency is only one part of the equation for cybercriminals like the Lazarus Group. Cashing out the stolen assets presents significant challenges due to the increased capabilities of law enforcement agencies and the rise of blockchain monitoring firms. When victims report wallet addresses containing stolen funds to exchanges, these exchanges can prevent the funds from being converted into other cryptocurrencies or traditional currencies. To overcome this, hackers often resort to using less reputable exchanges that charge high fees to launder the stolen funds. The efforts to track and prevent the conversion of stolen cryptocurrency demonstrate the collaborative work between cybersecurity firms, law enforcement agencies, and cryptocurrency exchanges to combat cybercrime.",

      "summary": "The idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs came from the observation that the intensity/color of the power LEDs can provide information about the beginning and end of cryptographic operations. This is because the brightness/intensity of a device's power LED is correlated with its power consumption, which in turn is affected by the CPU operations. The power LED is directly connected to the power line of the electrical circuit and lacks effective means of decoupling this correlation with power consumption, such as filters or voltage stabilizers.\n\nThe researchers discovered that vulnerable cryptographic algorithms (which are susceptible to side-channel attacks) and vulnerable power LEDs (which leak information through their color/brightness) can be exploited by attackers. By analyzing video footage of the power LED obtained through commercial video cameras, the attackers were able to recover secret keys from non-compromised devices. This approach is considered to be a weaker threat model compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods used for cryptanalysis because it does not require compromising the target device with malware and instead relies on commonly used sensors like video cameras.\n\nThe vulnerability does not originate from the power LED itself, but rather from the cryptographic libraries used in the devices. However, the power LED provides the necessary infrastructure for visually exploiting these vulnerabilities. To prevent such attacks, it is recommended to use the most updated cryptographic libraries available.\n\nThe researchers chose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks because these attacks highlight the fact that even recent cryptographic libraries can be vulnerable. Furthermore, the researchers cannot guarantee that using the most updated cryptographic libraries completely eliminates the risk, as new vulnerabilities may exist in the code. In the past, the known vulnerable cryptographic libraries were considered the most updated at that time.\n\nThe devices vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis include at least six smartcard readers from five manufacturers sold on Amazon, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S8. However, there may be additional devices that are also vulnerable.\n\nAttackers need to obtain video footage filled with the LED of the target device in order to perform cryptanalysis. This is because a high sampling rate is required for effective analysis. By filling the frame with the LED, the rolling shutter of the camera can be exploited to significantly increase the number of measurements of the color/intensity of the LED. The sampling rate can be increased by three orders of magnitude, from the frame per second (FPS) rate (e.g., 60 measurements per second) to the rolling shutter's speed (e.g., 60,000 measurements per second in iPhone 13 Pro Max). This increased sampling rate is necessary to attack functional IoT devices such as smartphones, smartcards, and TV streamers.\n\nIf a device does not have a power LED, it is not directly susceptible to secret key recovery through the power LED. However, attackers may still be able to recover the secret key indirectly by analyzing video footage obtained from a power LED of a connected peripheral.\n\nThe researchers came up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs through their understanding of the correlation between power consumption and the intensity/brightness of the power LED. This insight led them to explore the potential of utilizing video footage of power LEDs as a means to recover secret keys from vulnerable devices.",
      "summaryeli15": "A: The idea came from understanding that the power consumption of a device affects the intensity/brightness of its power LED, which can be detected by video cameras. Since certain cryptographic operations require a significant amount of CPU operations, the power consumption of the device during these operations also changes. By analyzing the changes in the intensity/brightness of the power LED, we can detect when cryptographic operations are happening. This led us to the idea of using video footage of power LEDs to recover secret keys. By exploiting the correlation between power consumption and power LED intensity, we can analyze the video footage to determine when cryptographic operations are occurring and extract the necessary information to recover secret keys.\n\nQ: Can you explain the vulnerability in the power LED and its relationship to the cryptographic libraries?\n\nA: The vulnerabilities lie in the cryptographic libraries themselves, not in the power LEDs. However, power LEDs provide a visual representation of the power consumption of the device, which allows us to exploit the vulnerabilities visually. The power LED is directly connected to the power line of the device's electrical circuit, and there are often no effective means of decoupling the correlation between power consumption and power LED intensity. This means that changes in power consumption during cryptographic operations directly affect the intensity/brightness of the power LED, providing us with a means to detect and analyze these operations visually.\n\nQ: How can video-based cryptanalysis be conducted using power LEDs?\n\nA: Video-based cryptanalysis involves capturing video footage of the power LED of a target device using a commercial video camera. The video footage is then analyzed to detect changes in the intensity/brightness of the power LED, which correspond to cryptographic operations. By carefully analyzing the timing and characteristics of these changes, we can extract the necessary information to recover secret keys. The rolling shutter feature of video cameras is particularly useful in this process, as it allows us to increase the sampling rate of the power LED measurements from the standard frames per second (FPS) rate to the rolling shutter's speed. This significantly increases the number of measurements we can obtain, providing us with the data needed to attack various devices.\n\nQ: How can attackers use video footage filled with the LED of the target device to exploit the rolling shutter?\n\nA: The rolling shutter is a feature of video cameras that captures the image sensor line by line rather than capturing the entire frame at once. This means that different parts of the frame are captured at slightly different times, allowing us to effectively increase the sampling rate of the power LED measurements. By filling the frame with the LED of the target device, we ensure that multiple lines of the image sensor capture the LED at different points in time. This effectively increases the number of measurements of the LED's color/intensity, allowing us to gather more data and improve the accuracy of our cryptanalysis. For example, in the case of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the rolling shutter's speed can provide up to 60,000 measurements per second, significantly increasing our ability to attack devices with high sampling rate requirements.\n\nQ: How can devices without a power LED still be at risk?\n\nA: If a device does not have an integrated power LED, attackers cannot directly recover secret keys from its power LED. However, they may still be able to conduct an indirect attack by obtaining video footage from a power LED of a connected peripheral. For example, if a device is connected to USB speakers that have a power LED, attackers can capture video footage of the USB speakers' power LED and analyze it to gather information about the device's cryptographic operations. This highlights the importance of considering not only the device itself but also its peripherals in terms of potential vulnerabilities.\n\nQ: What is the best way to protect against these attacks?\n\nA: The best way to protect against these attacks is to use the most updated cryptographic libraries available. It is important to regularly update and patch the cryptographic libraries used in devices to mitigate known vulnerabilities. However, it's worth noting that even the most updated libraries may still have undiscovered zero-day vulnerabilities, as vulnerabilities that are known today were once considered the most updated libraries themselves. Therefore, a combination of up-to-date libraries, rigorous security practices, and ongoing monitoring for potential vulnerabilities is necessary to minimize the risk of video-based cryptanalysis attacks.\n\nQ: Which devices are vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis?\n\nA: The specific devices vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis vary, but our research demonstrated vulnerabilities in smartcard readers and the Samsung Galaxy S8. We were able to recover secret keys from six smartcard readers manufactured by five different manufacturers that were sold on Amazon. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S8 was vulnerable to an indirect attack through the captured video footage of a connected peripheral's power LED. It's important to note that these are just examples, and there may be additional devices that are vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis.\n\nQ: Can you explain the difference between video-based cryptanalysis and other methods used to conduct cryptanalysis?\n\nA: Video-based cryptanalysis differs from other methods used to conduct cryptanalysis in a few key ways. First, it utilizes video cameras as the primary sensor to capture the necessary data for analysis, rather than dedicated professional sensors like scopes or electromagnetic radiation detectors. This makes video-based cryptanalysis more accessible and allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities without needing to compromise the target device with malware. Secondly, video-based cryptanalysis focuses on exploiting the vulnerabilities in both the cryptographic algorithms used and the power LEDs of the devices. By combining these two vulnerabilities, attackers can recover secret keys in a weaker threat model compared to state-of-the-art methods traditionally used for cryptanalysis. Ultimately, video-based cryptanalysis offers a new approach to attacking devices and highlights the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in both the algorithms and physical components of a system.",

The protocol offers leverage for yield farmers who deposit staked assets as collateral.\n\nAfter the issue was brought to their attention, the Sturdy Finance team acknowledged the attack and took action. They paused all markets to prevent further damage and assured users that no additional funds were at risk. They also stated that no user actions were required at that time.\n\nIt was noted by Ancilia, a blockchain security company, that the attack vector used in this exploit was similar to previous exploits on other platforms such as Midas Capital and dForce Network.\n\nThe attack involved the use of a flash loan to target the SturdyOracle, a component of the Sturdy protocol. The attacker manipulated the price of a collateral token called B-stETH-STABLE. The address of the attacker is 0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b, and the attack contract they used, which had front-running protection built in, is 0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab.\n\nThe attacker managed to make a profit of 442 ETH (equivalent to $800k) through this exploit. They quickly laundered the stolen funds by depositing them into Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused mixing service. This process was completed within just 20 minutes.\n\nThis type of vulnerability, known as read-only reentrancy, has been exploited in various attacks over the past year. In a February post on Balancer forums, it was mentioned that some Balancer pools are also susceptible to this attack vector. The specific pools targeted in the Sturdy Finance attack were identified as vulnerable.\n\nDespite the fact that Sturdy Finance had undergone three audits from reputable firms (Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena) and the exploit type was well-known, it is surprising that these vulnerabilities were not properly addressed.\n\nThese recent incidents have sparked discussions about the need for oracle-free lending systems, as this seems to be a recurring issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. However, it is worth noting that even oracle-free solutions may eventually require their own oracles to function properly.\n\nMoving forward, it is hoped that future DeFi protocols will be built on more secure foundations to prevent such attacks.

However, this incident highlights the ongoing threat of hackers.\n- EraLend lost $3.4M due to the same read-only reentrancy vulnerability that has been affecting various protocols in the cryptocurrency sphere. This emphasizes the need for more effective reentrancy protection protocols.\n\nI hope this provides you with the detailed explanation you were seeking.",

      "summary": "This passage is discussing a pull request on GitHub related to the Bitcoin code base. The pull request aims to improve the way seed nodes are used for bootstrapping the network.\n\nSeed nodes are alternative bootstrap mechanisms in the Bitcoin network. When a user specifies a seed node, the system makes a connection to that node and gathers addresses from it. The idea is that if users specify a seed node, they prefer addresses from that node over the fixed seed addresses.\n\nHowever, there was a race condition that occurred when disabling DNS (domain name system) seeds and specifying a seed node. In this scenario, the code immediately removed the entry from the list of addresses to fetch (m_addr_fetches) before the seed node had a chance to provide addresses. Once m_addr_fetches became empty, the system would fall back to using fixed seed addresses. This resulted in a race between the fixed seeds and seed nodes filling up the address manager (AddrMan).\n\nTo address this issue, the pull request suggests checking for any provided -seednode argument instead of relying on the size of m_addr_fetches. This change would delay the querying of fixed seeds for 1 minute when specifying any seed node, giving the seed nodes a chance to provide addresses before falling back to fixed seeds.\n\nThe suggested change can be tested by running a Bitcoin node with the command \"bitcoind -debug=net -dnsseed=0 -seednode=(...)\" on a node without a peers.dat file and observing the debug log.\n\nThe passage also includes some comments related to the review process for the pull request, such as conflicts with other pull requests and suggestions for further improvements.",
      "summaryeli15": "This explanation is about a code change proposal related to the way the Bitcoin software connects to the network and retrieves addresses of other nodes to connect to.\n\nThe code change is specifically about the \"-seednode\" option, which allows the user to specify a specific node from which to retrieve addresses. Currently, when this option is used, the software connects to the specified node, retrieves addresses from it, and then disconnects. The idea is that if the user specifies a seednode, they prefer to get addresses from that node instead of using the default fixed seeds.\n\nHowever, there is a problem when the user also disables DNS seeds (which are another way to obtain addresses). In this case, the software immediately removes the seednode entry from a list of addresses being fetched, before the seednode can provide any addresses. This leads to a race condition between the fixed seeds and the seednode filling up the list of addresses.\n\nThe proposed code change suggests a solution to this problem. Instead of using the size of the list of addresses being fetched, the code should check if any seednode has been provided. By doing this, the software will delay querying the fixed seeds for 1 minute when a seednode is specified. This gives the seednode a chance to provide addresses before the software falls back to using the fixed seeds.\n\nTo test this code change, one can run the Bitcoin software with the following command: \"bitcoind -debug=net -dnsseed=0 -seednode=(...)\" on a node that does not have a \"peers.dat\" file. Then, one can observe the debug log to see if the seednode is given time to provide addresses before the fixed seeds are used.\n\nThe code change has been reviewed by several people and they have provided their approval (\"ACK\") for it. They have also pointed out some suggestions for improvement, which have been addressed in subsequent commits.\n\nOverall, the goal of this code change is to prioritize seednodes when fetching addresses, especially when DNS seeds are disabled. This would provide a better user experience and improve the performance of the Bitcoin network.",

The library aims to provide well-engineered and reviewed components for Bitcoin-based applications. It is built upon the rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript crates.\n\nThe developers of Bitcoin Dev Kit are in the process of releasing a fundamental re-write of the library called v1.0. They have a roadmap for this project, which can be found at https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/road-to-bdk-1/. The timeline mentioned in the roadmap is not to be focused on. For an updated release timeline, you can refer to the bdk_core_staging repository, where a lot of component work is being done. The plan is to eventually move everything from the bdk_core_staging repo to the crates directory.\n\nThe project is organized into several crates located in the /crates directory. Additionally, there are fully working examples of how to use these components in the /example-crates directory.\n\nThe library should be able to compile with any combination of features using Rust version 1.57.0. However, if you want to build with the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV), you will need to pin dependencies for log and tempfile. Specifically, log 0.4.19 has an MSRV of 1.60.0+, so you can update it using the command `cargo update -p log --precise \"0.4.18\"`. Similarly, tempfile 3.7.0 has an MSRV of 1.63.0, and you can update it using `cargo update -p tempfile --precise \"3.6.0\"`.",
      "summaryeli15": "This passage is discussing a software library called bdk, which is a modern and lightweight wallet library written in the Rust programming language. The purpose of this library is to provide well-engineered and reviewed components for applications that are based on Bitcoin.\n\nThe bdk library is built upon two existing crates (which are code libraries in Rust): rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript. These crates are considered excellent and are widely used in the Rust ecosystem.\n\nThe developers of the Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK) are currently working on releasing version 1.0 of the library. This new version is a fundamental re-write of how the library works, and it is aimed at improving its functionality and performance. You can read more about the background and progress of this project on the website mentioned (https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/road-to-bdk-1/).\n\nThe bdk library is organized into multiple crates, which are located in the /crates directory. Each crate focuses on a specific component or functionality of the library. Additionally, there are fully working examples provided in the /example-crates directory, showcasing how to use these components in practice.\n\nTo compile the library, you will need to have Rust version 1.57.0 or higher. The library should be compatible with any combination of features provided by Rust. However, if you want to build the library with the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV), you will need to ensure that certain dependencies are pinned to specific versions. Specifically, the log crate should be pinned to version 0.4.18 or earlier, and the tempfile crate should be pinned to version 3.6.0. These commands using the \"cargo update\" tool will handle the pinning process.\n\nOverall, the bdk library is a valuable tool for developers who want to build Bitcoin-based applications in Rust.

They also provide a link to the project's documentation to see all available qualifiers. \n\nThey mention that if anyone has a question about the project, they can sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to contact the maintainers and the community. Clicking \"Sign up for GitHub\" indicates agreement to the project's terms of service and privacy statement. They also mention that occasional account-related emails may be sent.\n\nThe author explains the reason for confusion regarding the PR. They mention that a Mainnet descriptor matches with a Regtest address, and this is because the first network is used for setting the 2nd derivation index of Bipxx, while the second network is used for the address prefix. They note that as a result, if someone builds with the same Xpriv but uses build(Network::Regtest) to derive addresses, they will not match up with the test vector.\n\nThe author suggests two possible solutions. They propose changing the first network to Regtest in the build call or changing the second network to Mainnet. They mention that the first option requires a smaller changeset and can be done in a separate PR. \n\nAnother user agrees with the confusion raised by the first user and supports the first option. They mention opening an issue to keep track of the proposed changes. They also mention the need to rebase to pick up the new MSRV change from another PR (#842).\n\nThe author acknowledges the support for the first option and mentions their plan to submit a small PR for it before the end of the week. They also mention opening an issue to track this task.\n\nAnother user requests a rebase after the new \"bdk_core_staging\" changes from another PR (#793) are merged into the master branch. They suggest merging this PR into an upcoming 1.0.0-alpha release.\n\nThe author notes that the PR did not get merged before the major bdk 1.0 switch.

The PR is addressing issue #836, which means it is fixing a problem or adding something requested by users.\n\nSpecifically, this PR adds a P2TR descriptor template and a BIP86 taproot descriptor template. These templates allow users to create a taproot descriptor more easily. A taproot descriptor is a way to describe a type of bitcoin transaction output.\n\nThe reason for some confusion mentioned in the comments is because the mainnet descriptor (used on the main bitcoin network) was matching with a regtest address (used for testing purposes). This was happening because the mainnet descriptor was being used to set the second derivation index of a specific feature called Bipxx, while the regtest address was used for the address prefix.\n\nTo fix this, the PR suggests two options: either changing the first network to regtest in the code where the descriptors are built, or changing the second network to mainnet. The first option is considered a smaller change and can be done in a separate PR (another set of code changes submitted for review).\n\nThe comments also mention rebasing the PR, which means updating the code of the PR to match the latest changes made to the main codebase. This is necessary to ensure that the PR can be merged successfully.\n\nThe PR author and others involved in the discussion agree to proceed with the first option and plan to submit a separate PR for that change. They will also open an issue to keep track of the progress.\n\nThere is also a mention of merging this PR before merging another PR related to bdk_core (another component of the bitcoindevkit project). It is suggested to get this PR in before merging any new features and only merging critical bug fixes to the current version of the project.\n\nThere are additional comments discussing rebasing again, merging with the new master branch, and plans to use this feature for an iOS example app. The author of the PR confirms that it is ready to go and mentions creating an issue to address the issue raised by another user.\n\nIn conclusion, this PR adds new features to the bitcoindevkit project, specifically related to taproot descriptors.

      "summary": "Core Lightning is an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol that is lightweight, highly customizable, and compliant with the standards of the Lightning Network. It has been in use on the Bitcoin mainnet since 2018 and is considered stable and safe to use.\n\nTo get started with Core Lightning, it is recommended to experiment on a testnet or regtest environment. However, the implementation can also be used on the Bitcoin mainnet. Any help with testing, bug reporting, or addressing issues is welcome through various channels such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, or Telegram.\n\nPlease note that Core Lightning only works on Linux and macOS systems. It requires a locally or remotely running \"bitcoind\" (version 0.16 or above) that is fully synchronized with the network. The bitcoind must also relay transactions. Pruning is partially supported, and more details can be found in the documentation.\n\nIf you want to experiment with lightningd, there is a script to set up a local test network of two lightning nodes using bitcoind regtest. This script provides a convenient helper called \"start_ln\". Details on how to use it can be found in the \"startup_regtest.sh\" file.\n\nTo test with real Bitcoin, you need to have a local bitcoind node running and synchronized with the network. Make sure your bitcoin.conf file does not have \"walletbroadcast=0\" set, as it may cause issues. Running lightningd against a pruned node requires careful management.\n\nYou can start lightningd using a specific command that creates a \".lightning/\" subdirectory in your home directory. The man page \"lightningd.8\" or the documentation provides more information on available runtime options.\n\nCore Lightning exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. You can use the \"lightning-cli\" tool or a Python client library to access this interface. Using the \"lightning-cli help\" command will provide a table of RPC methods, and \"lightning-cli help <method>\" will offer specific information on a particular command.\n\nOnce you have started Core Lightning for the first time, you can use the \"bootstrap-node.sh\" script to connect to other nodes on the Lightning Network. Additionally, there are various plugins available for Core Lightning that add new capabilities. You can find a collection of plugins on GitHub.\n\nTo have funds available in lightningd, you need to transfer some funds from a Bitcoin wallet to lightningd to open a channel. The funds will be registered once the transaction is confirmed. You may need to generate a P2SH SegWit address if the faucet does not support bech32.\n\nOnce lightningd has funds, you can connect to a remote node and open a channel. The channel needs a few confirmations before it becomes usable and can be announced for others to use. You can check the status of the channel using \"lightning-cli listpeers\" and \"lightning-cli listchannels\".\n\nPayments in Lightning are invoice-based. The recipient creates an invoice with the expected amount, a unique identifier, and other details. The sender can pay the invoice using the \"lightning-cli pay\" command after decoding the payment using \"lightning-cli decodepay\".\n\nConfiguration of lightningd can be done through command line options or a configuration file. Command line options override values in the configuration file. A sample configuration file is available, and details on creating a configuration file can be found in the documentation.\n\nDevelopers interested in contributing to Core Lightning can start with the developer guide, and it is recommended to configure with \"--enable-developer\" for additional checks and options.\n\nOverall, Core Lightning is a reliable and customizable implementation of the Lightning Network protocol, and it provides various tools and options for testing, development, and production use.",

Core Lightning is lightweight, customizable, and compliant with the Lightning Network specification.\n\nYou can use Core Lightning to experiment with the Lightning Network on testnet or regtest, but it is also stable and can be safely used on the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\nThe Core Lightning implementation has been in production use since early 2018, and it has been used by the Blockstream Store. The development team welcomes help from the community in testing the implementation, reporting bugs, and resolving any outstanding issues. You can reach out to them on various platforms such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, or Telegram.\n\nCore Lightning is compatible with Linux and macOS operating systems. It requires a locally or remotely running bitcoind software (version 0.16 or above) that is fully synchronized with the Bitcoin network. It also requires bitcoind to relay transactions. Additionally, Core Lightning partially supports pruning, which is a way to reduce the disk space usage of bitcoind.\n\nTo experiment with the lightningd component of Core Lightning, there is a script called startup_regtest.sh that can help you set up a regtest test network with two local lightning nodes. This script provides a convenient helper called start_ln.\n\nIt's important to note that if you want your local nodeset to be faster and more responsive, you should configure your node to expose the developer options.\n\nTo test with real Bitcoin, you need to have a local bitcoind node running. You should wait until bitcoind has synchronized with the network before proceeding. Additionally, make sure that you don't have walletbroadcast=0 in your ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file to avoid any issues. If you're running lightningd against a pruned node, you should manage it carefully to avoid potential issues. See the provided link for more detailed information.\n\nCore Lightning exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. You can use the lightning-cli tool or a Python client library to access this interface. The lightning-cli help command provides a list of RPC methods and specific information about each command.\n\nAfter starting Core Lightning for the first time, you can use the contrib/bootstrap-node.sh script to connect to other lightning nodes on the network. Additionally, there are several available plugins for Core Lightning that add additional capabilities, which you can find on GitHub.\n\nTo ensure Core Lightning has funds to open a channel, you need to transfer funds to it. Once the transaction is confirmed, lightningd will register the funds. If the faucet you're using doesn't support bech32 addresses, you may need to generate a p2sh-segwit address.\n\nYou can then connect to a remote node and open a channel. This involves specifying the remote node's connection address and node ID. The channel will become usable after the funding transaction receives 3 confirmations and will be announced for others to use after 6 confirmations. You can check the status of the channel using the lightning-cli listpeers command.\n\nIn the Lightning Network, payments are invoice-based. The recipient creates an invoice specifying the expected payment amount, and the payer can use the lightning-cli pay command with the provided invoice to make the payment. Interacting with the Lightning Network through Core Lightning also provides lower-level interfaces and more options for advanced use cases.\n\nYou can configure lightningd either by passing options via the command line or by using a configuration file. Command line options always override the values in the configuration file. To use a configuration file, you need to create a file named config within your top-level lightning directory or network subdirectory. A sample configuration file is available for reference.\n\nFor developers interested in contributing to Core Lightning, there is a developer guide available. To enable additional checks and options during development, you should configure with the --enable-developer flag.\n\nOverall, Core Lightning is a powerful tool for exploring and working with the Lightning Network, providing spec compliance and performance optimization.",

However, there is some confusion about the ordering of the options when the \"--allow-deprecated-apis=false\" flag is used. The speaker is unsure if the alphabetical ordering without any specific ordering was intentional.\n\nIn response to a suggestion, the speaker agrees that showing which plugin an option belongs to would make it more understandable. They suggest adding a plugin array to the \"configs\" object, which would contain the path and options array for each plugin.\n\nThe speaker adds that it would be helpful for users to see more default values for options.

      "summary": "This paragraph is discussing an update to the core lightning project. When the core lightning program requests information about the blockchain using the \"getchaininfo\" command, it already has information about the minimum and maximum block heights. However, when a smarter Bitcoin backend is used that can switch between different clients, it is helpful to provide the current known height from lightningd (the lightning daemon) to the plugin. This allows the plugin to know the correct known height from lightningd and potentially fix any problems that may exist. This is particularly useful when syncing a new backend from scratch. By providing this information, the plugin can start syncing the chain and only return a response when the chain is in sync with the current status of lightningd.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions a specific case where the plugin is integrating a backend that is compatible with BIP 157 (a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). In this case, it is more convenient to use the \"wait_height\" function, which takes a maximum of a couple of minutes to sync, compared to the slower syncing process of Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe paragraph then states that the author is happy to work on a solution inside core lightning if the community does not think their proposed solution is correct. It also mentions that the changes made in this update should be documented in the \"docs/PLUGINS.md\" file and applied to the commit history. The update is built on top of an RFC (Request for Comments) from the core lightning project and the author has signed off on the changes.",
      "summaryeli15": "When the core lightning software asks for information about the blockchain using the \"getchaininfo\" command, it already knows the minimum and maximum block height. However, there can be a problem when using a more advanced Bitcoin backend that is capable of switching between different clients. In these cases, it would be helpful for lightningd (the core lightning daemon) to provide the current known block height to the plugins.\n\nBy passing this information down to the plugin, it can determine the correct known block height from lightningd and attempt to fix any issues that may exist. This is particularly useful when synchronizing a new backend from scratch, such as the one provided by the \"nakamoto\" project. By avoiding the return of a lower block height from the known information and preventing a crash of core lightning, the plugin can start synchronizing the chain and only return an answer when the chain is in sync with the current status of lightningd.\n\nThis feature was added to fix the switch backend functionality in the \"folgore\" project. The goal is to handle block heights below what is expected in a more graceful manner. One possibility to achieve this is by waiting for the underlying Bitcoin client (bitcoind) to catch up. However, waiting for bitcoind to sync up can be extremely slow, so the question arises of how long we should wait. The time required depends on various factors.\n\nThe proposed solution to this problem is to inform the plugin about the current known block height from lightningd. This allows for the initiation of syncing while moving the execution to another backend until the previous one is ready. The aim is to avoid being left in the dark when running the \"getchaininfo\" command and to have the option to wait for blockchain synchronization or dispatch the request elsewhere.\n\nIn the specific case of integrating a BIP 157 compatible backend, using the \"wait_height(..)\" function was convenient. This function takes a maximum of a couple of minutes compared to the much longer synchronization process of Bitcoin Core. However, the author is open to working on a solution within core lightning if it is deemed more suitable.\n\nTo implement this feature, the author of the pull request has built on top of an existing request for comments (RFC) from core lightning. The specific RFC can be found at the provided GitHub link. The changes have undergone review and minor adjustments, including updating the documentation to mention the new parameter. The changelog has also been added to the commit, though there was a missed check in the CI (continuous integration) process that should be addressed.",

      "summary": "Here is a detailed explanation of the provided text:\n\nThe text is describing Eclair, which is a Scala implementation of the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a protocol that enables fast and scalable transactions on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEclair follows the Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs) and is one of the implementations available alongside core lightning, lnd, electrum, and ldk.\n\nTo integrate Eclair into applications, it provides a feature-rich HTTP API that allows developers to easily interact with it. Detailed information on how to use the API can be found in the API documentation website.\n\nIt's important to note that the JSON API provided by Eclair should not be accessible from the outside world, similar to the Bitcoin Core API. This is for security reasons.\n\nIn order for Eclair to function properly, it relies on Bitcoin Core to interface with and monitor the blockchain. Eclair does not include an on-chain wallet and instead uses the Bitcoin Core node's on-chain funds. Channel opening and closing transactions are funded and returned to your Bitcoin Core node respectively.\n\nEclair uses its own bitcoin library to verify the data provided by Bitcoin Core. This allows Eclair to benefit from the verifications and optimizations implemented by Bitcoin Core, including fee management with RBF/CPFP (Replace-by-Fee/Child-Pays-For-Parent).\n\nTo run Eclair, you need to have Java installed, preferably OpenJDK 11. You can then download the latest release of Eclair, unzip the archive, and run it using specific commands.\n\nYou can control the Eclair node via the eclair-cli command-line tool or by using the API.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly read the official Eclair documentation before running your own node, as following outdated or incomplete tutorials/guides can lead to issues.\n\nEclair's configuration file is read from the default path (~/.eclair) and logs are written to the same location. If you want to change the configuration, you can create an eclair.conf file in the ~/.eclair directory.\n\nEclair will use the default loaded Bitcoin Core wallet to fund any channels you open. If you want to use a different wallet, you can set the eclair.bitcoind.wallet parameter in your eclair.conf.\n\nIt's recommended to tweak certain parameters in the Bitcoin Core bitcoin.conf file to unblock long chains of unconfirmed channel funding transactions using the Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) mechanism.\n\nThere are some advanced parameters that can be changed using Java environment variables, but most users won't need to modify them.\n\nIf you encounter Java heap size errors, you can increase the maximum memory allocated to the JVM using the -Xmx parameter.\n\nFor running multiple instances of Eclair on the same machine, using separate datadirs and changing ports in eclair.conf is mandatory.\n\nEclair uses logback for logging, and you can use a different logback configuration file to override the default one.\n\nTo backup Eclair, you need to backup specific files located in your data directory, including the database snapshot and the eclair.sqlite.bak file. It's recommended to use a temporary file during the backup process.\n\nThere is also information provided on running Eclair using Docker, configuring plugins, and running on different Bitcoin networks (mainnet, testnet, regtest, signet). The corresponding configuration changes are explained.\n\nThe text also provides examples for various commands and configuration settings related to running Eclair.",

It is recommended to use OpenJDK 11. You can download the latest release of Eclair, unzip the archive, and run the software using the provided command.\n\nEclair reads its configuration file and writes its logs to the `~/.eclair` directory by default. To change the configuration, you can create a file named `eclair.conf` in the `~/.eclair` directory. In this configuration file, you can set various parameters and customize the behavior of your Eclair node.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly read the official Eclair documentation before running your own node. You should also be cautious when following tutorials or guides that might be outdated or incomplete.\n\nTo use a different Bitcoin wallet with Eclair, you can set the `eclair.bitcoind.wallet` parameter in your `eclair.conf` file. However, changing the wallet when you have open channels can result in a loss of funds or require a complex recovery procedure.\n\nEclair recommends tweaking certain parameters in the Bitcoin Core configuration file (`bitcoin.conf`) to unblock long chains of unconfirmed channel funding transactions. These parameters include `mempoolexpiry`, `limitancestorcount`, `limitdescendantcount`, and `walletrejectlongchains`.\n\nIf you encounter Java heap size errors, you can increase the maximum memory allocated to the JVM using the `-Xmx` parameter.\n\nIf you want to run multiple instances of Eclair on the same machine, you need to use separate data directories and change the ports in the `eclair.conf` file.\n\nEclair supports plugins written in Scala, Java, or any JVM-compatible language. A valid plugin is a JAR file that contains an implementation of the Plugin interface. More details about plugins can be found in the eclair-plugins repository.\n\nBy default, Eclair is configured to run on the mainnet. However, you can also run it on testnet, regtest, or signet by modifying the chain parameter in the configuration file.\n\nIt's important to regularly back up your Eclair node's data directory, which contains the database snapshot (`eclair.sqlite.bak`) and other necessary files. Seeds, which are used to restore your node's channels, do not change once they are created.\n\nIf you are running Eclair as a Docker container, you can set environment variables to configure its behavior. You can also use the `-v` argument to make the data directory persistently available on your host machine.\n\nThe status of your Eclair node can be checked using the command-line tool or the API, depending on whether you have enabled the API.\n\nOverall, Eclair is a powerful implementation of the Lightning Network that requires careful configuration and management to ensure the security and reliability of your Lightning node.",

      "summaryeli15": "This comment is related to a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub, which is a proposed change to a codebase. The person who wrote this comment is providing feedback on the PR and asking the author to make some updates.\n\nThe purpose of the PR is to address a specific situation. It allows the \"sendtoroute\" remote procedure call (RPC) to set a maximum fee in millisatoshis (a unit of Bitcoin) for routing fees. If the routing fees exceed this maximum fee, the router will return a local error. This is important because it helps prevent situations where the routing fees become too high.\n\nThe reason for making this change is displayed so that others can understand the purpose of the change. The author of the PR is taking the feedback seriously and wants to update the release notes accordingly. Release notes are a document that provides information about the changes made in a software release.\n\nMerging this PR into the main codebase will result in a decrease in code coverage by 0.03%. Code coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of code that is executed during testing. A decrease in code coverage means that fewer lines of code are being tested.\n\nThere is also a note about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration. This integration provides additional features and services to improve the development workflow. If the organization doesn't install the integration, they may experience degraded service starting from May 15th.\n\nLastly, the comment mentions that merging this PR may close certain issues. This means that the proposed changes in the PR will address the problems reported in those issues, and once the PR is merged, those issues can be considered resolved.\n\nThe comment also includes a diff coverage percentage, which represents the percentage of lines changed compared to the total number of lines in the codebase.

      "summary": "In this text, the author is discussing a pull request (PR) that allows users to access historic channel data without relying on third-party services like LN explorers. The author mentions that they take user feedback very seriously and encourages users to sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and community.\n\nThe author emphasizes that the API is strictly for managing a user's node and they do not want to maintain too many unused APIs. They suggest that more exotic use-cases or analysis should be done directly on the database, preferably on the read-only replicated database to avoid impacting the running node.\n\nThe author mentions that this PR will make them famous, albeit not as famous as Rusty Russell. They also state that this feature provides more control over the node to users and helps retain their privacy.\n\nThe author acknowledges that accessing the database directly has been suggested before but mentions two problems. One problem is that the JSON format is not documented, but users can use their intelligence to figure out the structure. The other problem is that the author personally uses Python for their automation scripts and asks how to write a script that can tell if a channel was force closed using this data.\n\nThe author suggests adding pagination and making the count parameter mandatory to prevent listing all closed channels at once, which they believe would be too resource-intensive.\n\nThe author mentions merging the PR will increase coverage by 0.00% and notes that the organization should install the GitHub App Integration to prevent degraded service starting May 15th.\n\nThe author suggests optimizing performance for nodes with a lot of historical data by moving closed channels to their own table but acknowledges that, for now, performance is probably fine.\n\nThe author receives positive feedback on the PR and mentions a few comments on changes in the DB files. They state that it looks good, with the exception of those comments.\n\nFinally, the author celebrates the successful merging of the PR and shares a link to an article announcing the achievement.

      "summaryeli15": "This pull request (PR) is making changes to a project's code and functionality. The purpose of this PR is to allow users to access the historic channel data of their node without relying on external services. Currently, users need to use third-party services like LN explorers to access this information, but with this PR, they will be able to do it directly through the project's API.\n\nThe project team takes user feedback very seriously and considers it when making updates to the project. They encourage users to provide input and report any issues they encounter by opening an issue on GitHub. They also provide documentation for users to learn more about the available qualifiers for accessing the historic channel data.\n\nOne important note the team mentions is that while they want to provide users with more control over their nodes and enhance their privacy, they also want to avoid creating too many unused APIs. They specify that the API in this PR is strictly for managing the node and not for exotic use-cases or analysis. For those purposes, they recommend running directly on the project's database, ideally on the read-only replicated database to avoid impacting the running node.\n\nThe author of the PR mentions that implementing this feature will give them recognition similar to Rusty Russell, who is well-known in the Bitcoin community. They share a link to a newsletter that mentions their work. Additionally, they highlight that accessing the historic channel data will not only provide more control to users but also help maintain their privacy.\n\nThey address a concern about accessing the database directly, which has been suggested before. However, there are two problems associated with this approach. One is that the JSON format is not documented, but users can analyze the data structure using their own intelligence. The other problem is related to writing automation scripts in Python. The author seeks guidance on how to write a Python script that can determine if a channel has been force closed using the data accessed through this PR.\n\nThe author suggests adding pagination and making the count parameter mandatory when listing closed channels. They consider this necessary because the list of closed channels will continue to grow and could become very large over time, so retrieving all the information at once could be problematic. They propose a solution to avoid any potential issues.\n\nThe author mentions that merging this PR will increase code coverage by 0.00% and provides details about the coverage based on the code changes. They also include a warning regarding the organization's usage of the GitHub App Integration, which they recommend installing to avoid any service disruption.\n\nThe author states that while performance concerns exist for nodes with a significant amount of historical data, they believe the current implementation is acceptable and can be optimized later by moving closed channels to their own table.\n\nFinally, the author expresses satisfaction with the progress made and acknowledges a few comments on the changes in the DB files. They indicate that everything else looks good to them.\n\nIn conclusion, this PR aims to improve the project by allowing users to access their node's historic channel data directly through the API. It addresses privacy concerns and provides users with more control. The author seeks guidance on writing a Python script to detect force closed channels and suggests pagination to handle the potentially large amount of closed channel data. They also mention the impact on code coverage, a warning regarding the GitHub App Integration, and express their contentment with the progress made.",

      "summary": "This text appears to be a combination of various comments and updates related to a project. Let's break it down:\n\n1. \"We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\" This statement implies that the project team values and considers all feedback they receive.\n\n2. \"To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation.\" This sentence suggests that there is a documentation available with information about the qualifiers that can be used.\n\n3. \"Have a question about this project? Sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact its maintainers and the community.\" Here, it is mentioned that if anyone has questions or concerns about the project, they can sign up for a GitHub account, open an issue, and get in touch with the maintainers and community.\n\n4. \"By clicking 'Sign up for GitHub,' you agree to our terms of service and privacy statement. We’ll occasionally send you account-related emails.\" This is a standard notification that states by signing up for a GitHub account, the user agrees to the terms of service and privacy statement. It also mentions that occasional account-related emails might be sent.\n\n5. \"When sending a message, the postman can now ask the router to find a route using channels only. The same route is also used as a reply path when applicable.\" This sentence introduces a new feature where the postman (presumably a component or entity within the project) is now capable of requesting the router to find a route using channels only. This route can be used for sending a message and, in some cases, as a reply path.\n\n6. \"Merging #2656 (0d63fdc) into master (b084d73) will increase coverage by 0.08%. The diff coverage is 95.39%.\" This statement refers to a specific pull request (#2656) and mentions that merging it into the master branch will result in a coverage increase of 0.08%. It also indicates that the diff coverage, or the extent of code changes, is 95.39%.\n\n7. \"Your organization is not using the GitHub App Integration. As a result, you may experience degraded service beginning May 15th. Please install the GitHub App Integration for your organization. Read more.\" This notification is directed towards an organization that is not currently utilizing the GitHub App Integration. It warns that the service may be degraded starting from May 15th and suggests installing the integration to avoid potential issues. There is also an option to read more about it.\n\n8. \"This turned out more complex than I expected! I proposed some simplifications and refactorings in #2663. We're getting closer to an MVP release!\" This comment indicates that the project has become more complex than initially anticipated. However, the person making the comment has proposed some simplifications and refactorings in pull request #2663. It also mentions that the project is nearing a minimum viable product (MVP) release.\n\n9. \"I've merged your improvements but kept a separate routing algorithm for messages and payments. Routing messages is too different to be solved by the current payment routing algorithm, and I find it much simpler to separate the two than to try to make something generic.\" This statement suggests that the improvements made by someone have been merged, but they have chosen to maintain separate routing algorithms for messages and payments. The reason given is that routing messages requires a different approach compared to the existing payment routing algorithm.\n\n10. \"Now using Dijkstra for message routing too. We can prioritize big channels, old channels, and penalize disabled edges (but still be able to consider them). Rebased on master to fix a conflict.\" This update mentions that Dijkstra's algorithm is now being used for message routing. It states that certain factors such as big channels and old channels can be given priority, while disabled edges can be penalized. It also mentions that the code has been rebased on the master branch to resolve a conflict.\n\n11. \"DirectedGraph.makeGraph now takes 653ms instead of 225ms (x2.9). addEdges now takes 356ms instead of 2.676s to update the whole graph (x0.13). yenKshortestPaths now takes 2.578s to find paths to the top 1000 nodes compared to 2.345s before (x1.1).\" These performance metrics indicate the changes in execution time for specific functions or algorithms. DirectedGraph.makeGraph now takes 653ms instead of 225ms, addEdges now takes 356ms instead of 2.676s, and yenKshortestPaths now takes 2.578s instead of 2.345s. The multiplication factors (x2.9, x0.13, x1.1) indicate the relative change in execution time.\n\n12. \"I don't think writing ad hoc code for DirectedGraph.makeGraph is worth it as it is only called once at start-up. It looks like storing edges in a map instead of a list costs us 10% on the path-finding side and brings a 10x improvement on the update side.\" This statement suggests that the commenter believes writing specialized code for DirectedGraph.makeGraph is not necessary because this function is only called once at start-up. They point out that using a map instead of a list to store edges leads to a 10% performance decrease in path-finding, but it also improves the update process by 10 times.\n\n13. \"The code is looking good to me, that's really good work! I'm going to spend more time on the benchmarks and I'll report early next week.\" This comment expresses approval of the code and acknowledges the effort put into it. The person making the comment intends to dedicate more time to benchmarking the code and plans to provide a report early in the following week.\n\n14. \"Successfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\" This statement indicates that if the pull request is successfully merged, it may resolve or close some specific issues.\n\n15. \"@@ Coverage Diff @@ ## master #2656 +/- ## ========================================== + Coverage 85.85% 85.93% +0.08% ========================================== Files 214 215 +1 Lines 17591 17728 +137 Branches 723 752 +29 ========================================== + Hits 15102 15235 +133 - Misses 2489 2493 +4\" This section presents a coverage differential comparison between the master branch and pull request #2656. It shows an increase in coverage by 0.08%, along with the corresponding changes in the number of files, lines, branches, hits, and misses.\n\nIn summary, this text includes various statements and updates related to a project, such as new features, performance improvements, code changes, and merge considerations.",
      "summaryeli15": "This feedback is discussing changes made to a program or project. The feedback is focused on the merging of code changes, increasing code coverage, and the performance of certain functions.\n\nThe feedback mentions that when sending a message, the postman can now ask the router to find a route using channels only. This means that the program has been updated to allow the postman (or the entity responsible for sending messages) to use specific communication channels to deliver messages.\n\nThe feedback also mentions that merging code changes will increase code coverage by 0.08%. Code coverage refers to the percentage of code that is executed during testing. Increasing code coverage means that more parts of the code are being tested, which is generally a good thing as it helps identify bugs or errors.\n\nThe feedback mentions that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration and recommends installing it to avoid degraded service. GitHub is a platform commonly used for version control and collaboration on software projects.\n\nThe feedback also mentions that the project has become more complex than initially expected, and some simplifications and refactorings have been proposed. Refactoring refers to restructuring or reorganizing code to improve its readability, maintainability, or performance.\n\nThe feedback mentions that improvements have been merged, but a separate routing algorithm has been kept for messages and payments. This means that different algorithms are used for routing messages and processing payments, as they have different requirements and considerations.\n\nThe feedback mentions that Dijkstra's algorithm is now being used for message routing as well. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nThe feedback mentions that the performance of certain functions has changed after the code changes. For example, the time taken for DirectedGraph.makeGraph function has increased from 225ms to 653ms. This means that it now takes more time to execute this function. Similarly, the .addEdges function now takes less time to update the graph. These performance improvements are important as they can affect the overall efficiency and speed of the program.\n\nThe feedback also discusses the trade-offs made in the code changes. For example, storing edges in a map instead of a list has improved the performance of updating the graph but has slightly affected the path-finding side. Trade-offs like this are common in software development, where different approaches or data structures are chosen based on their impact on specific functionalities.\n\nThe feedback concludes by mentioning that the code looks good overall, but more time is needed to thoroughly test it before releasing it. It is also mentioned that benchmarks will be conducted to measure the performance of the code changes. Benchmarks help evaluate the performance and efficiency of the code in different scenarios.\n\nLastly, the feedback provides information about the code coverage difference in the master branch compared to the code changes in this pull request. It shows the number of lines covered and not covered by the tests, indicating the overall test coverage.\n\nOverall, this feedback highlights the changes made to the project, the impact on performance, and the need for further testing and evaluation before releasing the code changes.",

      "summary": "In this statement, the speaker is discussing some changes and updates that are being made to a project. They mention that they read and take feedback from users seriously. They also provide a link to documentation where users can find more information about the available qualifiers for the project.\n\nThe speaker mentions that there is a project related question and encourages users to sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue or contact the maintainers and community for assistance.\n\nNext, the speaker mentions that LND and CLN already use 2016 blocks and that the network is raising the values of \"cltv_expiry_delta\" to account for high on-chain fees. They state that in order to avoid rejecting payments, longer maximum deltas need to be allowed.\n\nThe speaker then mentions a merge request (#2677) that will decrease coverage by 0.01%. They also provide information about the diff coverage being 100%. It appears that the changes being made are related to code.\n\nThe speaker provides a warning about an organization not using the GitHub App Integration and states that degraded service may occur after May 15th. They suggest installing the GitHub App Integration for the organization and provide a link to read more about it.\n\nThe speaker then mentions a comment about a problem related to constants being defined in different places and suggests that a specific constant be read from nodeParams instead of being hidden in the code. They also question the need for another constant.\n\nAnother person responds to the comment and agrees with the points made, mentioning that they cleaned up the constants in Channel.scala. They express uncertainty about what to do with another constant in the Router and mention that providing the ChannelConf to the path-finding process would be unusual.\n\nThe second person concludes by mentioning that they need to review the changes a second time after the weekend to be sure of their decision. They also mention that successfully merging this pull request may resolve some outstanding issues.",
      "summaryeli15": "It seems like this conversation is taking place on GitHub, a popular platform for hosting and reviewing code. The comment is discussing a proposed change to the codebase, specifically in the areas related to LND (Lightning Network Daemon) and CLN (Cross-Layer Network).\n\nThe first statement mentions that LND and CLN are already using 2016 blocks. In the context of blockchain, a block is a collection of data, and in this case, it is referring to a specific number of blocks within the blockchain. The mention of 2016 blocks suggests that there is some time-related aspect being discussed.\n\nThe comment then goes on to discuss \"cltv_expiry_delta.\" This term refers to the delta, or difference, in the \"cltv_expiry\" (CheckLockTimeVerify) values. In simpler terms, it is referring to the time period that a transaction output is locked for before it can be spent. The comment mentions that the network is increasing this delta value to account for high on-chain fees, which are the fees associated with transactions recorded on the blockchain. By allowing longer maximum deltas, the goal is to avoid rejecting payments due to these fees.\n\nThe next part of the comment mentions a proposed merge of a pull request (#2677) into the \"master\" branch of the codebase. When a pull request is merged, it means that the proposed changes will be incorporated into the main body of code. The comment states that this merge will decrease coverage by 0.01%. Coverage refers to the amount of code being tested, and a decrease suggests that less code will be tested as a result of this merge. The diff coverage, which is mentioned as 100.00%, likely indicates that the changes made in the pull request have been fully tested.\n\nThen there is a warning about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration and potential degraded service starting May 15th. It recommends installing the GitHub App Integration to prevent this.\n\nThe following statement raises some concerns about certain constants being defined in different parts of the codebase. Constants are values that do not change during the execution of a program. The person suggesting the change suggests that one specific constant, \"MAX_CLTV_EXPIRY_DELTA,\" should be read from a different place, possibly a configuration file called \"nodeParams,\" instead of being hardcoded in the code. They also question the necessity of another constant called \"DEFAULT_ROUTE_MAX_CLTV\" and mention that they have cleaned up the constants in one specific file called \"Channel.scala.\"\n\nThe commenters discuss the implications of changing the \"DEFAULT_ROUTE_MAX_CLTV\" constant and mention that providing the \"ChannelConf\" to path-finding, a process used to determine the best path for a payment in a network, might be complex.\n\nThe discussion ends with someone expressing their approval of the proposed changes, but mentioning that they would need to review it again after the weekend to be completely certain. They also mention that merging the pull request might close certain issues that were opened in the codebase.\n\nOverall, this conversation revolves around making changes to the codebase related to the Lightning Network and addressing specific constants used in the code. The commenters discuss the potential effects and challenges of these changes before ultimately expressing support for the proposed modifications.",

It suggests that there are two reasons for the existence of default fee rates, which will likely be discussed further in subsequent statements.\n\n9. \"The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\": This sentence, which seems to be unfinished or missing some context, mentions that a reason will be displayed to describe a comment to others. It provides an instruction to learn more about this feature or action.\n\n10. \"This is looking good, much better than the previous block targets!\": This sentence expresses a positive opinion about something, indicating that it is better than the previous block targets.\n\n11. \"I don't know what we can do honestly, since we want to handle bitcoind restarts...I don't think we want to persist the latest fees, it's better to avoid a frequent DB call, so we need external input from the node operator (which is why hard-coded values in eclair.conf make sense, even though it's not very satisfying).\": This statement reflects the speaker's uncertainty about the appropriate action to take regarding managing bitcoind restarts and persisting the latest fees. It suggests that persisting the fees in a database would result in frequent database calls, which should be avoided. Instead, they propose obtaining external input from the node operator and express the opinion that using hard-coded values in eclair.conf (configuration file) is logical, albeit unsatisfying.\n\n12. \"Successfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\": This sentence suggests that merging a specific pull request may result in the closure of related issues. It implies that the pull request's changes address or resolve those issues.\n\n13. \"@@ Coverage Diff @@ ## master #2696 +/- ## ========================================== - Coverage 85.86% 85.78% -0.08% ========================================== Files 215 215 Lines 17626 17637 +11 Branches 762 737 -25 ========================================== - Hits 15134 15130 -4 - Misses 2492 2507 +15\": This statement provides a coverage diff or difference in code coverage between the master branch and a specific pull request (#2696). It includes metrics such as the percentage of coverage, number of files and lines, and the number of branches, hits (covered lines), and misses (uncovered lines).\n\n14. \"Move away from the 'block target' approach. Get rid of the FeeEstimator abstraction and use an AtomicReference to store and update the current feerates, similar to the block count. In particular, we set them in human-readable sat/byte. Also, use satoshis-per-byte.\": These sentences suggest a change in approach or methodology regarding the \"block target\" concept. The speaker suggests eliminating the FeeEstimator abstraction and replacing it with an AtomicReference to manage and update current fee rates, similar to how the block count is handled. They mention that the fee rates will be set in human-readable satoshis per byte units and emphasize using satoshis per byte as the unit of measurement.",

The primary crate in rust-lightning, called lightning, is designed to be agnostic to the underlying runtime environment. This means that you can use different modules provided by LDK (Lightning Development Kit) for tasks like data persistence, chain interactions, and networking or you can create your own custom implementations.\n\nThe project is known for its performance and flexibility. It implements all of the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) specifications, which are the standard specifications for the Lightning Network protocol. The library has been in production use since 2021. The developers highlight the importance of careful attention to detail for safe deployment in any Lightning implementation.\n\nCommunication related to rust-lightning and the Lightning Development Kit happens through the LDK Discord channels. The passage also mentions the availability of a sample node implementation that fetches blockchain data and manages on-chain funds using the Bitcoin Core RPC/REST interface.\n\nThe library does not provide everything out of the box, but the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) offers implementations for various functionalities. The customizability of LDK was presented at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in February 2020.\n\nThe goal of rust-lightning is to provide a fully-featured and flexible Lightning implementation, allowing users to decide how they want to use it. The library exposes functionality through simple, composable APIs. The passage suggests referring to the About section for more information about the library's flexibility.\n\nThe developers emphasize the importance of security and discourage adding new dependencies to the library. They mention the need to persuade Andrew (presumably an individual involved in the project) to reduce dependency usage in rust-bitcoin, another Rust library.\n\nThe passage clarifies that rust-lightning refers to the core lightning crate within the given repository, while LDK encompasses rust-lightning and all its sample modules, crates, language bindings, sample node implementations, and other tools related to Lightning integration or building a Lightning node.\n\nThe passage ends by welcoming contributors to the project and mentioning the availability of a CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidance. It also states that the library is licensed under either the Apache-2.0 or MIT license, allowing users to choose between them. Finally, there is a repetition of the initial sentence, highlighting that the library is rust-lightning and not Rusty's Lightning.",
      "summaryeli15": "The text you provided is a description of a software library called rust-lightning. This library is written in the Rust programming language and is designed to be highly modular, meaning that it can be easily customized and adapted for different use cases.\n\nOne of the main features of rust-lightning is its implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. The Lightning Network is a protocol designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. By using rust-lightning, developers can build applications that leverage the Lightning Network for their Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe library consists of several crates, with the main one being called \"lightning.\" This crate is designed to be runtime-agnostic, meaning that it can work with different environments and platforms. In addition to the lightning crate, rust-lightning also provides sample modules for data persistence, chain interactions, and networking. However, developers have the flexibility to provide their own custom implementations for these components if desired.\n\nRust-lightning fully implements the specifications defined in the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) standards. These standards define the protocols and rules for the Lightning Network. The library has been in production use since 2021, which means that it has been tested and used in real-world scenarios.\n\nTo support communication and collaboration among developers, rust-lightning has a Discord server where discussions and support take place. This server is called LDK Discord channels.\n\nThere is also a sample node provided as part of rust-lightning, which demonstrates how to fetch blockchain data and manage funds on-chain using the Bitcoin Core RPC/REST interface. This sample node shows how different components of rust-lightning can be combined to build a functional Lightning node.\n\nIt's important to note that rust-lightning does not provide certain functionalities out of the box, but the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) has implementations for them. LDK is a broader framework that encompasses rust-lightning and additional components like language bindings, sample implementations, and other tools for Lightning integration. The goal of rust-lightning and LDK is to provide a flexible and customizable Lightning implementation, allowing developers to decide how they want to use it.\n\nThe developers of rust-lightning have emphasized the importance of security and minimal dependencies. They strongly advise against adding new dependencies to the library, especially ones with additional dependencies. The motivation for this is to ensure the stability and security of the library.\n\nContributions to the project are welcome, and there is a guide called CONTRIBUTING.md that provides information on how to contribute.\n\nThe license for rust-lightning is either Apache-2.0 or MIT, giving users the option to choose between the two licenses.\n\nOverall, rust-lightning is a powerful and flexible library for building Lightning Network applications in Rust, and it provides a range of features and customization options for developers.",

Here is a breakdown of the main points discussed:\n\n- The speaker mentions that they read every piece of feedback and take input seriously.\n- They suggest checking the documentation for available qualifiers.\n- It is mentioned that if someone has a question about the project, they can sign up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and the community.\n- There is a discussion about the current representation of funded and unfunded channels using a single Channel struct. It is mentioned that this conflation of state makes it harder to reason about and less safe to call appropriate methods on Channel to advance the state. The speaker proposes the idea of using three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager instead of using a ChannelKind enum.\n- The speaker suggests splitting this into multiple commits, possibly creating a context object in a regular channel first, then adding the trait, and finally splitting the code further.\n- They mention the need to coordinate on landing this change to avoid conflicts with other changes and suggest getting some concept ACKs before moving forward.\n- There is a discussion about dropping the ChannelKind enum in favor of three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager. The speaker explains that initially, they started implementing this approach but became concerned about handling a second map while working with an OccupiedEntry. However, they agree to split the code as suggested by the other person and see how it works.\n- The conversation includes some technical discussions related to RefCell, method signatures, and different patterns to avoid certain issues.\n- There is a mention of interior mutability cropping up and confusion about why it is happening. It is clarified that interior mutability is occurring with certain methods and using self.get_context() in the trait, but it can be resolved by taking &mut self in the method signature instead.\n- The speaker mentions their plan to push up some changes in the morning and acknowledges that their previous explanation may not have been clear.\n- A quick explanation is requested regarding the design in dual-funding and whether certain structs should be renamed or if the same PreFundingChannel should be used for both initiator and initiatee sides.\n- The difficulty and challenges of refactoring the channel are discussed, with the speaker mentioning that channel refactoring is trickier than anticipated.\n- The speaker mentions that they have made progress on splitting the code and resolving borrow conflicts but realize that generalizing things might not be necessary.\n- The conversation briefly touches on the idea of splitting the code further and defining different stages for channels (pre-funding, post-funding, and operation stages) to enforce certain conditions and make the code more organized.\n- The speaker specifies their plan to revert to having funding_signed on Channel instead of OutboundV1Channel to maintain consistency between temp_chan_id and chan_id in the maps.\n- There is a mention of opening a follow-up issue to track all the feedback, bugs, and improvements mentioned in the conversation and ensure they are addressed in future updates.\n- Some specific suggestions and feedback are provided for the code changes, and the speaker acknowledges the feedback and plans to address it.\n- The conversation concludes with some final comments and approval of the changes made. It is mentioned that there are still some places in channelmanager that need updating and a follow-up issue is needed to track and resolve those.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this conversation, a group of developers is discussing a code change related to channels in a project. The code change involves separating funded and unfunded channels into separate structures and maps, instead of having them represented by a single structure. This change aims to improve code organization and make it easier to work with channels.\n\nOne developer suggests dropping the ChannelKind enum and having three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager. This would eliminate the need for the enum and allow for clearer and safer method calls on channels. Another developer suggests splitting the code change into multiple commits to make it easier to review and understand.\n\nThey also discuss the need for coordination in landing the code change, as it may conflict with existing code. They mention the importance of getting approval from their peers before merging the code and suggest setting aside time to review and merge it together.\n\nThe developers go on to discuss the challenges they have encountered while working on the code change. They mention concerns about handling a second map while working with an OccupiedEntry, as well as difficulties with using RefCell due to constraints with common method signatures. They plan to try different patterns to address these issues.\n\nThe discussion continues with the developers discussing the design of the code change in relation to dual-funding. They consider renaming the structs and explain the need for separate structs for initiator and initiatee channels. They question whether the design should only apply to legacy channels or if it should also be used for v2 channels. They acknowledge that the refactoring process has been trickier than expected.\n\nThey mention the need to make assumptions about the channel_by_id map and the possibility of bugs slipping through with the refactor. They also discuss the potential for bugs and merge conflicts with the enum-and-single-map approach. They decide that having separate maps for channels would reduce the surface area for bugs and make the code change easier to review and merge.\n\nThe discussion goes on to touch on topics such as interior mutability, code coverage, and the need to address specific issues in follow-up work. They address minor comments and nitpicks in the code and provide suggestions for further improvements. Overall, the developers express their satisfaction with the progress and acknowledge the complexity of the code changes.",

But no strong feelings if the docs are updated.\"\nThis comment suggests another possible name for the `find_route` function, which is \"get_intermediate_hops.\" The comment mentions that there are no strong feelings about the name and that updating the documentation could resolve any confusion.\n\n20. \"Another option could be to pass in a new onion_message::Path (or similar name) into send_onion_message, consolidating the intermediate_nodes and destination parameters. Then find_path could return a Path. This'd be in-line with our payment apis.\"\nThis comment suggests an alternative approach to handling the routing of onion messages. It proposes passing a new `onion_message::Path` structure into the `send_onion_message` function, which would consolidate the `intermediate_nodes` and `destination` parameters. The `find_path` function would then return a `Path` structure. The rationale for this approach is to align with the payment APIs used in the project.\n\n21. \"@TheBlueMatt Would you be ok with that or will this make bindings difficult?\"\nThis comment asks for feedback from the developer \"@TheBlueMatt\" regarding the alternative approach suggested in the previous comments. It specifically asks if this approach would cause any difficulties with the project's bindings.\n\n22. \"Discussed offline and at the review club. Renamed to find_path taking a Destination by value and returning a new OnionMessagePath struct. Also, updated OnionMessenger::send_custom_message to take this struct instead of the two parameters as suggested earlier.\"\nThis comment summarizes the offline discussion and review club feedback regarding the naming of the `find_route` function. It mentions that the function was renamed to `find_path` and now takes a `Destination` parameter by value. It also states that the `OnionMessenger::send_custom_message` function was updated to take the `OnionMessagePath` struct instead of the two previous parameters.\n\n23. \"Regarding naming, not sure if I should rename MessageRouter to OnionMessageRouter for consistency with the new struct and OnionMessageContents.\"\nThis comment discusses a potential renaming of the `MessageRouter` trait to `OnionMessageRouter` for consistency with the new `OnionMessagePath` struct and the existing `OnionMessageContents`.\n\n24. \"@TheBlueMatt Would you be ok with that or will this make bindings difficult?\"\nThis comment seeks feedback from the developer \"@TheBlueMatt\" regarding the potential renaming of the `MessageRouter` trait.\n\n25. \"Not sure why this would make the bindings difficult?\"\nThis comment asks for clarification on why the potential renaming of the `MessageRouter` trait would make the project's bindings difficult.\n\n26. \"The concern was around having two items in different modules named Path.\"\nThis comment provides an explanation for the concern regarding the potential naming conflict between the `Path` structure and another item in a different module.\n\n27. \"Ah, yea, we can't do that for bindings, and really shouldnt do it for rust users either.\"\nThis comment acknowledges the concern regarding the naming conflict with the `Path` structure and agrees that it should be avoided for both project bindings and Rust users.\n\n28. \"Make it clearer here that find_route should return only intermediate_hops to the destination?\"\nThis comment reiterates the suggestion made earlier to make it clearer that the `find_route` function should only return intermediate hops to the destination.\n\n29. \"I would expect a find_route call to also include the pubkey of the final node (or intro node), but when it's used in the next commit with send_custom_message it's expected to only return the intermediate hops.\"\nThis comment restates the expectation that the `find_route` function should also include the pubkey of the final node or intro node, but clarifies that in the context of the next commit's use of `send_custom_message`, it is expected to only return the intermediate hops.\n\n30. \"Perhaps there's a better name than find_route or at very least a better name for what it is returning. Open to suggestions.\"\nThis comment reiterates the suggestion made earlier to find a better name for the `find_route` function or its return value, indicating that the developer is open to suggestions.\n\n31. \"This would be for if there is a direct connection between sender and recipient.\"\nThis comment elaborates on the purpose of the `find_route` function, specifying that it would be used in cases where there is a direct connection between the sender and recipient.\n\n32. \"find_hops? Sounds like a task for a brewery though.\"\nThis comment refers to the previous suggestion of renaming the `find_route` function to \"find_hops\" and adds humor to the discussion by mentioning that it sounds like a task for a brewery.\n\n33. \"Could be get_intermediate_hops since that's the wording used in send_custom_message? But no strong feelings if the docs are updated.\"\nThis comment suggests another possible name for the `find_route` function, which is \"get_intermediate_hops.\" The comment mentions that there are no strong feelings about the name and that updating the documentation could resolve any confusion.\n\n34. \"Another option could be to pass in a new onion_message::Path (or similar name) into send_onion_message, consolidating the intermediate_nodes and destination parameters. Then find_path could return a Path. This'd be in-line with our payment APIs.\"\nThis comment introduces another alternative approach to handling the routing of onion messages. It suggests passing a new `onion_message::Path` structure, or a similar structure, into the `send_onion_message` function. This structure would combine the `intermediate_nodes` and `destination` parameters. The `find_path` function would return this `Path` structure. The rationale for this approach is to align with the payment APIs used in the project.\n\n35. \"@TheBlueMatt Would you be ok with that or will this make bindings difficult?\"\nThis comment seeks feedback from the developer \"@TheBlueMatt\" regarding the alternative approach suggested in the previous comment. It specifically asks if this approach would cause any difficulties with the project's bindings.\n\n36. \"Discussed offline. For now we'll leave the trait but may want to have the ChannelManager implementation produce an event in the future.\"\nThis comment summarizes the offline discussion and indicates that, for the time being, the trait will be left as is, but there may be plans to have the ChannelManager implementation produce an event in the future.\n\n37. \"Most of the stuff I was thinking to comment on while reviewing was already addressed by others so LGTM 👍\"\nThis comment indicates that most of the concerns or questions the reviewer had were already addressed by other comments, and they give their approval for the pull request (\"LGTM\" stands for \"Looks Good To Me\").\n\n38. \"Can someone explain the &amp;* here? I've been running into this more lately and haven't quite understood it.

I get basic de/referencing and that implementing the Sized trait means having a known constant size at compile time but don't understand it's use/need in this context.\"\nThis comment asks for an explanation of the `&amp;*` syntax and questions the need for the `Sized` restriction on `OMH::Target` (OffersMessageHandler's target type). The commenter mentions that they understand basic de/referencing and the `Sized` trait but don't understand its use in this context.\n\n39. \"Can someone explain the &amp;* here? I've been running into this more lately and haven't quite understood it.\"\nThis comment reiterates the previous question about the `&amp;*` syntax and mentions that the commenter has encountered this syntax more often lately but still does not fully understand it.\n\n40. \"self.custom_handler is a type implementing Deref where the Target implements CustomOnionMessageHandler. respond_with_onion_message wants a reference of a type implementing ResponseErrorHandler, which is a supertrait. It seems just calling deref() would have sufficed.\"\nThis comment explains the purpose of the `&amp;*` syntax. It mentions that `self.custom_handler` is a type that implements `Deref`, where the `Target` implements `CustomOnionMessageHandler`. The `respond_with_onion_message` function requires a reference to a type that implements `ResponseErrorHandler`, which is a supertrait. The comment suggests that simply calling `deref()` could have been sufficient in this case.\n\n41. \"Also I notice if I remove the Sized restriction on OMH::Target: OffersMessageHandler + Sized--which is self.offers_handler's type--this gets a warning and I also don't really understand why.

Sounds like a task for a brewery though.\"\nThis comment refers to the previous suggestion of renaming the `find_route` function to \"find_hops\" and adds humor to the discussion by mentioning that it sounds like a task for a brewery.\n\n52. \"Seems like mostly trivial changes? Hope we can land this soon!\"\nThis comment suggests that the changes in the pull request are relatively simple and expresses hope for the pull request to be merged soon.\n\n53. \"The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\"\nThis comment is a placeholder indicating that the reason for the comment will be displayed to others.\n\n54. \"Yeah, though the spec is underspecified.\"\nThis comment acknowledges that the specification is underspecified, indicating that it lacks sufficient detail or clarity.\n\n55. \"I left a comment: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798/files#r1200840518\"\nThis comment mentions that the developer left a comment on a specific line in the code, which can be found in the provided URL.\n\n56. \"I wonder if we should just ignore erroneous_field and suggested_value since they are odd and not very useful at the moment.\"\nThis comment proposes ignoring the `erroneous_field` and `suggested_value` fields, as they are considered odd and not very useful at the moment.\n\n57. \"The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\"\nThis comment is a placeholder indicating that the reason for the comment will be displayed to others.\n\n58. \"FYI, I added an additional error here. Discussion from the spec meeting indicated the error fields are meant to be generic enough for future uses. So might as well support reading them at least.\"\nThis comment informs that an additional error was added and justifies the support for reading the error fields by stating that the fields are meant to be generic enough for future uses, as discussed in a specification meeting.\n\n59. \"The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more.\"\nThis comment is a placeholder indicating that the reason for the comment will be displayed to others.\n\n60. \"Hmm... seems I'd have to update all the Readable / ReadableArgs impls back to wire::Message to take a logger to use here. Perhaps it would be better to make a new DecodeError variant wrapping the ParseError to avoid that? That was we could log in PeerManager. Let me know if you have a preference or another idea.\"\nThis comment discusses a potential issue with logging in the `decode_args` function. The solution proposed is to update the `Readable` and `ReadableArgs` implementations to take a logger, or alternatively, create a new `DecodeError` variant that wraps the `ParseError` to allow logging in the `PeerManager`. The commenter seeks feedback and suggestions for addressing this issue.\n\n61. \"Went ahead and made a couple new DecodeError variants. PTAL\"\nThis comment indicates that the proposed solution to the logging issue was implemented by adding new `DecodeError` variants. The commenter requests a review of the changes.\n\n62. \"Why do we need this additional trait, instead of returning a Result from handle_custom_message? We could also add an event for failed OM handling.\"\nThis comment questions the need for the additional `ResponseErrorHandler` trait and suggests instead returning a `Result` from the `handle_custom_message` function. It also suggests adding an event for failed onion message handling.\n\n63. \"The error happens after calling handle_custom_message when OnionMessenger attempts to send the reply. This avoids reentrancy when if instead the user was given a reference to OnionMessenger to directly send the reply.\"\nThis comment explains the reason for the error occurring after calling `handle_custom_message` and clarifies that it avoids reentrancy when the user is given a reference to `OnionMessenger` to directly send the reply.\n\n64. \"Would it be reasonable to implement EventsProvider for Messenger and generate OM failure events there? Seems in line with what we do for outbound payment path failures.\"\nThis comment proposes implementing `EventsProvider` for `Messenger` and generating onion message failure events within it. The commenter suggests that this approach would be in line with how outbound payment path failures are handled.\n\n65. \"Possibly... @TheBlueMatt is there any concern here? I'd imagine we may want to avoid onion messages from an untrusted source filling our event queue at no cost. At very least the cost for an outbound payment is to tie up liquidity.\"\nThis comment considers the concern of potential onion messages from an untrusted source filling up the event queue without a cost. It suggests that at the very least, there is a cost involved in outbound payments (such as tying up liquidity).\n\n66. \"Discussed offline. For now we'll leave the trait but may want to have the ChannelManager implementation produce an event in the future.\"\nThis comment states that offline discussions have taken place regarding the concerns raised about handling onion message failures. It is decided to leave the trait as is for the time being, but there may be plans to have the `ChannelManager` implementation produce an event in the future.\n\n67. \"Most of the stuff I was thinking to comment on while reviewing was already addressed by others so LGTM 👍\"\nThis comment indicates that most of the reviewer's concerns or questions have already been addressed by other comments.

For that to work it has to be generic in DecodeError and parsing BOLT12 messages have to map InvoiceError to DecodeError.\"\nThis comment discusses the inclusion of the specific TLV that generated the error in the `InvoiceError` type. It suggests that the TLV should be filled in regardless of whether the error was due to an invalid TLV (e.g., too many bytes or invalid value) or a semantic error. The comment also mentions that for this to work, the `DecodeError` type needs to be generic, and the parsing of BOLT 12 messages should map `InvoiceError` to `DecodeError`.\n\n75. \"Does this need some kind of currently-connected-peers set?\"\nThis comment raises a question about the need for a currently-connected-peers set in the code.\n\n76. \"Hmm... perhaps? Currently, this is called from OnionMessenger::respond_with_onion_message via OnionMessenger::handle_onion_message, which is passed the id of the peer who delivered the message.

The lnd is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node, which is a network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enable faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe lnd supports various back-end chain services, including btcd (a full-node), bitcoind, and neutrino (an experimental light client). These services provide the underlying blockchain functionalities for the Lightning Network.\n\nThe lnd's codebase utilizes the btcsuite set of Bitcoin libraries and also includes a wide range of isolated re-usable libraries specifically related to the Lightning Network. This modular approach allows developers to build applications on top of the lnd more easily.\n\nThe Lightning Network specifications, known as BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology), are being developed by multiple implementers, including the lnd developers. The lnd implementation aims to fully conform to these specifications, but both the specifications and the implementation are still a work-in-progress.\n\nTo facilitate application development, the lnd offers two primary RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces: an HTTP REST API and a gRPC service. However, it should be noted that these API interfaces are not stable yet, meaning they may undergo significant changes in the future.\n\nFor developers, the lnd provides an automatically generated set of documentation for the RPC APIs, available at api.lightning.community. Additionally, there are various developer resources, such as guides, articles, example applications, and community resources, accessible at docs.lightning.engineering.\n\nThe lnd also maintains an active community on Slack, where protocol developers, application developers, testers, and users gather to discuss lnd-related topics and the Lightning Network in general.\n\nIf you want to build the lnd from source, you can find the installation instructions. Alternatively, if you prefer to use Docker, there are specific instructions available for running lnd using Docker.\n\nWhen operating an lnd node on the main Bitcoin network (mainnet), it is essential to follow the operational safety guidelines provided by the lnd developers. These guidelines are crucial because lnd is still considered beta software, and ignoring the guidelines can result in the loss of funds.\n\nSecurity is of paramount importance to the lnd developers, as it affects the overall health of lnd, user privacy, and the Lightning Network as a whole. If you discover any security or privacy issues, the developers urge you to disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to security at lightning dot engineering. They also encourage encrypting the email using their designated PGP key (91FE464CD75101DA6B6BAB60555C6465E5BCB3AF), which can be found on their website.",
      "summaryeli15": "The given text is a detailed explanation of the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd). The Lightning Network is a protocol designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions on blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin. The lnd is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node, which means it is a software that can participate in the Lightning Network and perform Lightning Network-specific tasks.\n\nThe lnd software supports different back-end chain services, such as btcd, bitcoind, and neutrino. These services provide different ways to interact with the underlying blockchain network. For example, btcd is a full-node that stores and validates the entire blockchain, while neutrino is a lighter client that relies on other nodes for blockchain data.\n\nThe lnd project builds upon the btcsuite set of Bitcoin libraries, which provide various tools and functionalities related to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Additionally, lnd exports a set of libraries that can be used by developers to build Lightning Network applications.\n\nThe main goal of lnd is to fully conform to the Lightning Network specification, which is currently being drafted by multiple groups of developers. This specification, known as BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology), defines the rules and protocols that Lightning Network nodes must follow.\n\nThe lnd software is developer-friendly and provides two primary RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces: an HTTP REST API and a gRPC service. These interfaces allow developers to interact with and control the lnd node programmatically. However, it is important to note that these APIs are still under development, meaning they may undergo significant changes in the future.\n\nTo help developers and users understand and use the RPC APIs, the lnd project provides automatically generated documentation, which can be found at api.lightning.community. Additionally, the project offers various developer resources, including guides, articles, example applications, and community resources at docs.lightning.engineering.\n\nThe lnd project also maintains an active Slack community where developers, testers, and users can join discussions about lnd and the Lightning Network in general. This community serves as a platform for collaboration and support.\n\nTo use lnd, one can either build it from source by following the provided installation instructions or run it using Docker, as explained in separate Docker instructions.\n\nWhen running a live lnd node on the main Bitcoin network (mainnet), it is crucial to follow the operational safety guidelines provided by the lnd project. These guidelines ensure the security of funds and the proper functioning of the software.

      "summary": "In this PR (Pull Request), the developers have made several changes to the codebase. Let's break down each change and its purpose:\n\n1. Extracting musig2 session logic: In this commit, the musig2 session logic is extracted into a new package and struct. This allows for reusability of the session logic in tests without having to create the entire wallet system.\n\n2. Updating the chanfunding package: In this commit, preparations are made to update the chanfunding package to be compatible with the new musig2 channels.\n\n3. Generating nonces for local sessions: In this commit, a counter-based system is implemented to generate nonces that are sent to the remote party in the local session. The commitment height is used as the underlying counter, and it is used by the existing shachain producer to generate fresh and deterministic randomness. This eliminates the need to store the secret nonce to disk, as the nonce can be regenerated when needed using the stored signature.\n\n4. Implementation of funding logic: The next PR in this series will use the changes made in this PR to implement the funding logic within the wallet itself, specifically for reservations.\n\n5. Review comments and addressing feedback: The developers have addressed review comments, such as adding unit tests and enforcing checks to prevent repeated nonces.\n\n6. Cleaning up MuSig2 sessions: A discussion is taking place regarding cleaning up MuSig2 sessions and ensuring proper error handling. The developers are considering making changes to the session cleanup process and ensuring that sessions are properly closed when the connection is terminated.\n\n7. Linter issues and final clean up: Some linter issues remain, but the developers expect to address them in a final clean-up commit once all the other changes are implemented.\n\n8. Summary of code changes: The last commit in the PR updates the set of intents and assemblers to recognize musig2, adds abstractions for funding and state updates in taproot channels, removes code duplication, and introduces the use of multimutexes to improve session management.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the codebase by modularizing the musig2 session logic, preparing for the introduction of musig2 channels, and implementing nonce generation and session cleanup mechanisms.

However, in this particular PR, we need to send a nonce, but we don't yet know the transaction hash, so we can't do that. We will still include this feature when signing new commitments, as the transaction hash will be known at that point.\n\nTo address the issues with the PR, there are a couple of linter errors that need to be fixed.\n\nIn response to your question about why this is named \"simple taproot,\" it originated from a proposal that aimed to include various features (taproot, PTLCs, new commitment type, scriptless scripts) all at once. However, it was deemed too ambitious, so a staged rollout proposal was suggested. The staged rollout proposal involved introducing features incrementally, starting with the musig2 output, followed by PTLC and scriptless script, and finally the commitment format changes. This staged rollout proposal was then named \"simple taproot.\"\n\nAs for the calculation of the witness script for taproot channels, it is not blocking here. It will be calculated at the time of spending since we need to know which branch we are spending from to build the control block. Another option is to add a bool variable \"isLocalCommit\" to the CommitScriptToSelf method, which would allow pre-computing and returning the witness script and control block. This would eliminate the need to derive the tree twice.\n\nHowever, please note that in later commits in this PR series, the code is modified further to include the full script tree information.\n\nIn one of the later commits, there is a note left for other reviewers regarding the update of lc.currentHeight. It is mentioned that since NewAnchorResolutions creates a new LightningWallet, which makes a separate call to the database, the lc.currentHeight should always be up to date at that point. This is acceptable because StateCommitmentBroadcasted only calls it when the database has the latest view of the local commit, and no other goroutines can update it anymore because it's closed.\n\nFinally, the commit successfully compiles and passes the relevant tests.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the PR better.

      "summary": "In this commit, several changes are made to improve the default configuration values and remove deprecated features of an application called LND. LND is an open-source Lightning Network Daemon written in Go.\n\nOne of the changes is the addition of two functions: `DefaultWtclientCfg` and `DefaultWatchtowerConfig`. These functions are responsible for populating default values for the `lncfg.Wtclient` and `lncfg.Watchtower` config structs respectively. The purpose of populating default values is to ensure that when a user runs the `lnd --help` command, they can see the default configuration options available to them. This helps users understand the possible configurations and make informed choices.\n\nThe `DefaultWtclientCfg` function is used to populate default values for the `Wtclient` struct. The `Wtclient` struct is a data structure that holds configuration options related to the Watchtower client in LND. By providing default values, users who do not specify these options explicitly can rely on the defaults supplied by the function.\n\nSimilarly, the `DefaultWatchtowerConfig` function is responsible for constructing a default `lncfg.Watchtower` struct. This struct holds configuration options related to the Watchtower service in LND. By providing default values, users can see the possible configuration options and make adjustments if needed.\n\nAnother change in this commit is the removal of the `PrivateTowerURIs` member from the `Wtclient` config struct. This member was deprecated since version v0.8.0-beta of LND. \"Deprecation\" means that the feature is no longer recommended to be used and might be removed in future versions. The removal of this member is important because LND would fail to start if a user specified it as a configuration option. Removing deprecated features ensures the stability and proper functioning of the application.\n\nBy making these changes, the developers are improving the default configuration experience for users of LND and ensuring the removal of deprecated features that can cause issues.

Registration and Recovery:\n   - Registration and recovery processes are managed by the scheduler.\n   - The commands explained in the walkthrough are prefixed with \"scheduler\" to indicate that they are related to registration and recovery.\n   - During registration, the application receives an mTLS certificate and a private key. These should be stored securely for future communication.\n   - A signature from the key manager is required for registering as a new user.\n   - The recovery process also relies on the key manager providing a signature.\n\n8. Connecting to the Node:\n   - Once the registration/recovery process is complete, the node can be reached using the provided URI.\n   - The glcli tool automatically looks up the current location for the node.\n\n9. Attaching the hsmd (Hardware Security Module Daemon) to the Node:\n   - The hsmd can be attached to the node using a specific command.\n   - Running the hsmd alongside other commands is recommended for good practice.\n   - Future versions of glcli will automatically spawn an hsmd instance when needed.\n\n10. Managing the Node:\n    - After attaching the hsmd, the node can be managed as if it were a local node.\n    - Various operations like sending/receiving on-chain and off-chain transactions, opening/closing channels can be performed.\n\n11. Language Bindings and Secret Generation:\n    - The provided language bindings expect a securely generated 32-byte secret.\n    - This secret is used to generate private keys and other secrets.\n    - The secret must be kept safe on the user's device and must not be stored on the application server, as it controls user funds.\n    - Generating the seed secret according to the BIP 39 standard is recommended.\n    - The mnemonic associated with the seed should be shown during creation but should not be shown afterward.\n\n12. Supported Networks:\n    - Blockstream Greenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest.\n    - Testnet is suggested for testing purposes, but regtest and signet will also be added in the future to simplify testing.\n    - Testnet can be less stable, but the lightning network running on it functions well.\n\n13. Infrastructure and Load-balancing:\n    - Currently, there is a single cluster in us-west2 hosting the Blockstream Greenlight environment.\n    - The plan is to implement geo-load-balancing of the nodes and associated databases to reduce roundtrip times globally.\n    - The current roundtrip times can be relatively high from more distant regions.\n    - An mTLS handshake requires multiple roundtrips, but this will be optimized with load-balancing.\n    - It is recommended to keep the gRPC connections open and reuse them whenever possible to minimize the overhead of the mTLS handshake.\n\n14. Example Commands:\n    - The text provides example commands for using the glcli tool, such as registration, recovery, scheduling, and basic node information retrieval.\n    - Additional commands related to managing funds, peers, and channels are also mentioned.\n    - Each command is accompanied by the JSON payload format expected by the command.\n\nOverall, the text provides a detailed explanation of Blockstream Greenlight, its features, and how to interact with it using the provided tools and commands.",
      "summaryeli15": "Blockstream Greenlight is a platform that allows users to run their own Lightning node in the cloud. It provides a number of services that can be integrated into applications, as well as tools to manage and control the node.\n\nTo get started with Blockstream Greenlight, you can use the python glcli command line tool. This tool is already built and available for download, so you don't have to worry about compiling anything.\n\nDuring installation, if you encounter any issues, it may be because there is no prebuilt version of the gl-client-py library for your platform. In that case, you will need to refer to the library's documentation on how to build it from source. You can also let the Blockstream team know about your platform so they can add it to their build system in the future.\n\nRegistration and recovery processes are managed by the scheduler. The scheduler is responsible for handling the creation and maintenance of nodes. When you register as a new user, the scheduler provides you with an mTLS certificate and a private key. These credentials are used to authenticate and authorize your application with the Blockstream Greenlight services. You should store these credentials on your device and use them for all future communication with the services.\n\nThe recovery process also involves the key manager, which provides a signature for authentication purposes.\n\nOnce you have the necessary credentials, you can use the glcli command line tool to interact with the scheduler and access your node. The tool allows you to schedule the node, attach the hsmd (hardware security module daemon) to the node, and manage various aspects of the node, such as on-chain and off-chain transactions, channel operations, and more.\n\nWhen using the language bindings provided by Blockstream, you need to generate a 32-byte secret that will be used to generate private keys and other secrets. This secret should be securely generated and kept safe on your device. It should not be stored on the application server, as it grants access to your funds. It is recommended to generate the secret according to the BIP 39 standard and show the mnemonic during the creation process. However, the mnemonic should not be shown afterwards to ensure the security of your funds.\n\nBlockstream Greenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest. Testnet is recommended for testing purposes, as it is specifically designed for testing and may perform better than the other networks. The team plans to open up the regtest network and add signet in the future to further simplify the testing process.\n\nAt the moment, the Blockstream Greenlight infrastructure consists of a single cluster in the us-west2 region. Both the scheduler and nodes are located in this region. However, the team plans to implement geo-load-balancing of the nodes and associated databases to reduce roundtrip times for users in other regions.\n\nTo install the gl-client and glcli packages using pip, you can use the following commands:\n\npip install -U gl-client\npip install --extra-index-url=https://us-west2-python.pkg.dev/c-lightning/greenlight-pypi/simple/ -U glcli\n\nAfter installation, you can use glcli to interact with the scheduler and manage your node. The provided commands allow you to register, recover, schedule, get information about your node, and perform various other operations.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the concepts of Blockstream Greenlight and how to get started with it using the glcli command line tool.",

The bot is gaining popularity, especially in Latin America, where people are using Bitcoin as an alternative currency in dictatorial regimes like Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nHowever, there is a concern that Telegram may be subject to censorship or government intervention in the future. To address this, the project proposes the use of a platform called Nostr, which can provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange system. The document explains how this system can be implemented without relying on a centralized platform like Telegram.\n\nThe system involves a component called Mostro, which acts as an escrow between the buyer and seller. It utilizes a Lightning Network node to handle Bitcoin transactions. The node generates hold invoices for sellers and regular invoices for buyers. Mostro requires a private key to create, sign, and send events through the Nostr network.\n\nTo enable users to buy and sell Bitcoin through Mostro, clients need to be developed, starting with a web client. The project plans to build mobile and desktop clients in the future. The goal is to make it easy for anyone to become a Mostro, although running a Mostro will require a Lightning Network node with sufficient liquidity and high uptime. Mostros will compete for users, and users will rate Mostros based on their experience. Bad Mostros will be rejected by users and lose incentives.\n\nThe document provides instructions on how to compile the Mostro project on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS and connect it to a Lightning Network node. It also explains how to set up the database and initialize it using SQLx_cli. Additionally, it provides instructions on running the project with a private dockerized relay.\n\nLastly, a sequence diagram is shown to illustrate the interaction between the Seller, Mostro, Lightning Network Node, and Buyer in a simplified version of the system's workflow.\n\nPlease note that this explanation is based on the information provided in the given text and may not cover all possible details or aspects of the project.",
      "summaryeli15": "In 2021, a project called @lnp2pbot was started to allow people to buy and sell Bitcoin through the Lightning Network without requiring personal data or KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. @lnp2pbot is a Telegram bot that has been growing steadily and is being used worldwide, particularly in Latin America where the local currencies are facing significant issues.\n\nWhile the bot has been successful so far, there is a concern that Telegram, the platform on which it operates, may become subject to censorship or government intervention at some point. To address this, the project is exploring the use of Nostr, a platform that can provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial environment for a Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange.\n\nTo enable this exchange on Nostr, a component called Mostro is being developed. Mostro will act as an escrow, providing security to both buyers and sellers in their transactions. It will handle Bitcoin using a Lightning Network node, which will create hold invoices for sellers and receive regular invoices for payment from buyers.\n\nTo operate on Nostr, Mostro needs a private key to create, sign, and send events through the network. The development of Mostro is currently being carried out using Rust programming language.\n\nTo buy or sell Bitcoin using Mostro, users will need two things: Mostro's clients and a Lightning Wallet. Initially, a web client will be built, with plans to develop mobile and desktop clients in the future.\n\nThe project aims to make it easy for anyone to become a Mostro and participate in the exchange. However, being a Mostro requires running a Lightning Network node with high uptime and sufficient liquidity for fast operations. These resources can be funded by the fees paid by sellers on each successful order. Each Mostro can set its own fee percentage.\n\nUsers will have the ability to rate Mostros based on their experience, and Mostros will compete to attract more users in order to survive. Poorly rated Mostros may lose incentives and user trust, leading to their removal from the platform.\n\nTo compile the Mostro code on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, the user needs to install Cargo and run several commands, including cloning the repository and creating a settings.dev.toml file. In this file, various variables, such as the LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node details and the database URL, are set.\n\nBefore building the project, the database needs to be initialized using sqlx_cli. Once the setup is complete, the project can be run using the cargo run command.\n\nIf the user wants to use a private dockerized relay, additional steps need to be followed, including spinning up a docker container with an instance of nostr-rs-relay.\n\nThe text also includes a sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction between the seller, Mostro, and the Lightning Network node in a summarized version. The diagram shows the process of requesting and receiving a hold invoice, making a payment, and confirming the payment.\n\nIn conclusion, the project aims to provide a decentralized and secure platform for buying and selling Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, ensuring privacy and reducing the risk for both buyers and sellers. The use of Nostr and the development of Mostro are key elements in achieving this goal.",

Qualifiers and Documentation: The software has a set of qualifiers that determine its functionality. The documentation provides more information on these qualifiers.\n\n3. CLI and GitHub Desktop: Munstr offers a Command Line Interface (CLI) for efficient work. You can also use GitHub Desktop, a graphical interface, to interact with the software.\n\n4. Codespace Preparation: If there is an issue with preparing the codespace, you can try again or download GitHub Desktop to resolve the problem.\n\n5. Munstr Overview: Munstr combines MuSig (multisignature) keys based on Schnorr signature scheme with decentralized Nostr networks. It operates in a terminal-based wallet and aims to securely transport and digitally sign Bitcoin transactions. The design prevents chain analysis from identifying the nature and setup of the transaction data. These transactions appear as single key Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) spends to external observers.\n\n6. Interactive Multisignature Wallet: Munstr provides an interactive multisignature (n-of-n) Bitcoin wallet. It enables a group of signers to collaborate on taproot-based outputs using an aggregated public key.\n\n7. Beta Software: As of now, Munstr is in the beta stage, and the developers advise against using it with real funds. They may change the code and authors, and the maintainers do not take responsibility for any losses or damages.\n\n8. Open Source: The Munstr software is open source, meaning anyone can use it or contribute to its development.\n\n9. Multisignature Keysets: Munstr employs multisignature keysets to reduce the risk associated with single key usage.\n\n10. Encrypted Communications: Munstr utilizes Nostr decentralized events for encrypted communication. This ensures that the data exchanged during the signing process remains secure.\n\n11. Signer's Responsibility: The signer is responsible for using their private keys from the multisignature keyset to digitally sign a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT).\n\n12. Nostr Network: The Nostr decentralized network serves as a transport and communication layer for the PSBT data.\n\n13. Coordinators: Coordinators act as intermediaries between the digital signers and wallets. They facilitate the collection of digital signatures from the required number of key signers (n-of-n) and assist in broadcasting the fully signed transaction.\n\n14. Additional Libraries: In addition to the libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file, the Munstr project incorporates other libraries for its functionality.\n\n15. License: Munstr is licensed under the MIT License, and its copyright is held by TeamMunstr.\n\nFinally, the mentioned command \"cp src/coordinator/db.template.json src/coordinator/db.json\" is used to copy the template file to a specific location, and \"./start_coordinator.py\" is the command to start the coordinator script.",

This wallet is designed to support an interactive, multi-signature setup where all signers must participate in order to authorize the transaction.\n\nIt's important to note that Munstr is currently in beta and should not be used with real funds. The code and authors might change, and the maintainers are not responsible for any lost funds or damages caused by using this software.\n\nSome key features of Munstr include:\n\n- Open source: Anyone can use the technology or contribute to its development.\n- Multisignature keysets: The use of multiple signatures reduces the risk associated with a single key setup.\n- Encrypted communications: The Nostr decentralized network is used to securely transmit and communicate partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT).\n\nIn the context of Munstr, the signer is responsible for using their private keys within the multisignature keyset to digitally sign a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT). The Nostr decentralized network acts as a transport and communication layer for the PSBT data, ensuring its secure transmission.\n\nCoordinators play a crucial role in the Munstr ecosystem. They act as mediators between the digital signers (who possess the private keys) and the wallets.

      "summary": "The passage describes a proposed solution for a proof-of-liabilities (PoL) scheme in the context of an ecash system. The PoL scheme focuses on verifying the liabilities (outstanding balance) of a mint, which is responsible for issuing and redeeming ecash tokens. The passage assumes that the proof-of-reserves (PoR) part, which verifies the mint's on-chain assets, has already been addressed using conventional methods.\n\nIn the proposed scheme, when a user (let's call her Carol) wants to withdraw her funds onto her Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment to someone else, she sends the ecash to the mint. The mint then burns (destroys) the ecash and pays the Lightning invoice of the same value. This burning process ensures that ecash tokens have a relatively short lifetime, as they are destroyed at every transaction and payout onto Lightning.\n\nHowever, this continuous burning and creation of ecash tokens can result in the lists of issued signatures and burned tokens growing quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly. To address this, the proposed solution introduces key rotation.\n\nKey rotation involves periodically changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint. This mechanism of key rotation can be leveraged to construct the PoL scheme. The key rotation process is visualized in figure (a) of the passage.\n\nThe publicly released PoL reports include all mint proofs, which are the blind signatures issued by the mint, and all burn proofs, which are the redeemed secrets (information needed to reclaim the ecash). A cheating mint would try to manipulate these lists by artificially shortening the list of mint proofs and inflating the list of burn proofs.\n\nTo detect a cheating mint, users can keep track of all blind signatures they receive from the mint during a specific keyset epoch and publicly prove that they obtained a blind signature that is not listed in the mint proof list. This can be done by using a database of blind signatures provided by the Cashu wallets. A user can call out a mint if their blind signature is not found in the PoL reports.\n\nIf a user contests a PoL report, they need to prove that they have a valid signature from the mint. This is done by providing a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof, which allows others to verify that the contested signature is indeed from the mint. However, revealing the DLEQ proof removes the privacy of the contesting user, as it links the minting and burning of the specific ecash token.\n\nAnother way a mint could potentially lie about its PoL report is by including fake burn proofs in its list of spent secrets. By spinning up a wallet and spending unbacked ecash, the mint can artificially increase the amount of allegedly redeemed ecash and reduce the outstanding balance it reports.\n\nIn the most optimal scenario, past epochs of ecash tokens will fully clear, meaning the sum of minted tokens will equal the sum of burned tokens, resulting in an outstanding balance of zero. In this case, a user with a token that was not accounted for in the burn proof report can immediately prove that the mint is adding fake proofs to the report.\n\nBy implementing key rotation on an agreed-upon schedule, the mint commits publicly to not add any additional fake mint proofs to their past PoL reports. Users can validate the mint proof lists once they are released and easily detect whether new entries are added or legitimate ones are removed. User wallets adopt a policy of refusing tokens from epochs other than the most recent one, further reinforcing accountability.\n\nThe rotation of keys introduces an \"arrow of time\" into the token dynamics, enforced by users themselves. User wallets refuse to accept tokens from older keysets, forcing all tokens from past epochs to move into the newest keyset. This periodic \"bank run\" simulation allows users to observe past epochs and determine whether the mint has manipulated the reports.\n\nOverall, the PoL scheme proposed in the passage ensures that a cheating mint can only artificially inflate its liabilities, but it cannot reduce them without the risk of being caught. Guardians of the reserves will demand withdrawals if the mint inflates liabilities, and users have the ability to detect and contest any manipulations.\n\nThe PoL scheme outlined in the passage offers improved auditability for the ecash system. However, it acknowledges that there are remaining problems that the proposal does not address.\n\nIf there are any issues or suggestions for improvement with the scheme, the passage encourages reaching out for further discussion and feedback.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this problem, we are discussing a Proof-of-Liabilities (PoL) scheme for an electronic cash (ecash) system. The PoL part focuses on ensuring that the liabilities of the ecash mint, which is responsible for issuing and redeeming the ecash, are accurately reported.\n\nTo understand the PoL scheme, let's first discuss the overall process of how ecash transactions work. When a user, let's say Carol, wants to withdraw funds from her ecash wallet or make a payment using ecash, she sends the ecash to the mint and requests the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value. The mint then \"burns\" or destroys the ecash, making it no longer usable. This ensures that each unit of ecash can only be spent once.\n\nNow, the lifetime of an ecash token is relatively short because it is burned at every transaction and when it is transferred onto the Lightning network. This means that the list of issued signatures (proofs of minting) and the list of burned tokens (proofs of redemption) can grow quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly.\n\nTo address this, the PoL scheme uses a mechanism called key rotation. Key rotation involves periodically changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint for issuing blind signatures and by the users for verifying the signatures. By doing this, the mint can release publicly visible reports, called PoL reports, that contain all the mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and burn proofs (redeemed secrets) for a specific key epoch.\n\nThe PoL reports are crucial for detecting any manipulation or cheating by the mint. A cheating mint would try to artificially shorten the list of mint proofs and inflate the list of burn proofs to disinflate its liabilities and reduce its outstanding balance.\n\nTo prevent this, users of the ecash system can keep track of all the blind signatures they have received from the mint during a specific key epoch. If they find a blind signature that is not listed in the mint proof list of the corresponding epoch, they can publicly call out the mint for cheating. To prove the validity of their blind signature, the user who contests the report provides a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof, which allows others to verify that the signature is indeed from the mint. However, it's important to note that revealing the DLEQ proof removes the unlinkability of the specific ecash token, compromising the privacy of the contesting user.\n\nThe second way a mint could lie about its PoL report is by including fake burn proofs in its list of spent secrets. This means that the mint could create unbacked ecash, spend it using a separate wallet, and then report these transactions as burn proofs. By doing so, the mint can inflate the amount of allegedly redeemed ecash and reduce the outstanding balance it reports.\n\nTo detect this kind of manipulation, the PoL scheme relies on the fact that in the most optimal case, the sum of minted tokens should equal the sum of burned tokens for each key epoch. If a user finds a token from a previous epoch that was not accounted for in the burn proof report, it immediately triggers suspicion for all other users. This creates a cost-benefit balance that discourages the mint from adding fake burn proofs.\n\nBy rotating the keys in an agreed-upon schedule, the mint commits to not adding any additional fake mint proofs in the past PoL reports. Users can validate the mint proof lists once they are released and easily detect whether new entries are added or legitimate ones are removed further on. Additionally, user wallets adopt a policy to refuse tokens from epochs other than the most recent one, further preventing any manipulations.\n\nOverall, the PoL scheme for ecash ensures that the liabilities of the mint are accurately reported and detects any attempts by the mint to inflate or manipulate its liabilities. It works by using key rotation, publicly released PoL reports, user verification of blind signatures, and detection of fake burn proofs.",

      "summary": "LDK Node is a library that allows developers to quickly and easily set up a self-custodial Lightning node. It is built using LDK and BDK, which are Lightning and Bitcoin libraries respectively. With LDK Node, developers can have a Lightning node up and running within a day.\n\nLDK provides defaults for settings and configurations, but to fully utilize its features and interconnected modules, a deeper understanding of the protocol fundamentals and familiarity with the LDK API is required. Additionally, LDK does not come with an included on-chain wallet, as it adheres to the separation-of-concerns principle. Therefore, users need to integrate LDK with a suitable on-chain wallet of their choice.\n\nTo address the complexity and learning curve of using LDK, LDK Node was created as a more fully-baked solution. It hides protocol complexities without compromising usability. The API surface of LDK Node is much smaller and simpler compared to LDK, with only around 30 API calls available. Despite its simplicity, LDK Node remains configurable enough to operate a fully functional self-custodial Lightning node in various use cases.\n\nWhen designing an API that handles protocol complexity, there is a trade-off between simplicity and expressiveness. Increasing configurability and interconnectivity of components can lead to a more complicated API, requiring users to spend more time studying and understanding it. LDK Node leans towards simplicity while still providing enough expressiveness to meet the needs of developers.\n\nThe initial release of LDK Node comes with a set of design choices and ready-to-use modules. The main goal of the Lightning protocol is to enable fast, private, and secure Bitcoin transactions for end users. However, most Lightning deployments today are custodial services, accessible only through client devices. Deploying self-custodial Lightning nodes on end-user devices is challenging, and LDK Node aims to simplify this integration, particularly for mobile applications.\n\nThe features of the initial release of LDK Node are specifically tailored for mobile deployments. It integrates with an Esplora chain data source and a Rapid Gossip Sync server, allowing the node to operate in mobile environments with limited bandwidth and traffic quota.\n\nLDK Node is primarily written in Rust, but it also provides language bindings for Swift, Kotlin, and Python based on UniFFI. Additionally, Flutter bindings are available for usage in mobile environments.\n\nThe main abstraction in the LDK Node library is the Node. To obtain a Node instance, developers need to set up and configure a Builder according to their preferences and then call one of the build methods. The Node can then be controlled using commands such as start, stop, connect_open_channel, and send_payment.\n\nThe code example provided demonstrates the usage of LDK Node. It shows how to create a Builder, configure it with network settings, Esplora server, and Gossip Sync server. The Node is built from the Builder and started. It then creates a new on-chain funding address, connects to a specific node, waits for an event, handles the event, sends a payment using an invoice, and finally stops the Node.\n\nIn summary, LDK Node is a library that simplifies the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes, particularly for mobile applications. It provides a straightforward interface, hides protocol complexities, and offers ready-to-use modules. While it requires some understanding of the protocol and API, it reduces the effort needed to set up a Lightning node and enables fast and secure Bitcoin transactions for end users.",
      "summaryeli15": "LDK Node is a library that helps developers easily set up a Lightning node. A Lightning node allows for fast, private, and secure Bitcoin transactions. LDK Node provides a simple interface and includes an integrated on-chain wallet, making it easier to create a self-custodial Lightning node.\n\nLDK Node is built using LDK and BDK, which are libraries that handle the Lightning protocol and Bitcoin transactions, respectively. LDK Node makes use of sane defaults to simplify the setup process. However, to fully configure and customize the node, some knowledge of the protocol and the LDK API is required.\n\nOne important thing to note is that LDK Node does not come with its own on-chain wallet. This means that users need to integrate it with a compatible on-chain wallet of their choice. This can require some effort, but it allows for flexibility and gives users control over their funds.\n\nTo address the complexities of the Lightning protocol, LDK Node offers a smaller API surface compared to LDK. While LDK exposes over 900 methods, LDK Node's API is reduced to around 30 API calls. This reduces the complexity and makes it easier to work with.\n\nLDK Node is designed to strike a balance between simplicity and expressiveness. The API should be easy to use while still allowing for customization and flexibility. When APIs become more complicated, they provide more options and control but also require users to spend more time learning and understanding them. LDK Node leans towards simplicity, but still offers enough configurability to suit various use cases.\n\nThe first release of LDK Node includes several ready-to-use modules and design choices. The focus is on simplifying the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. The features are tailored for mobile deployments and consider the limitations of bandwidth and overall traffic quota. An integration with Esplora chain data source and Rapid Gossip Sync server helps optimize mobile environments.\n\nLDK Node is primarily written in Rust, but it also provides language bindings for Swift, Kotlin, and Python through UniFFI. Additionally, Flutter bindings are available for mobile usage.\n\nThe main abstraction in LDK Node is the Node object. To use LDK Node, developers need to set up and configure a Builder object according to their requirements. Once the configuration is done, developers can call the build method to retrieve the Node object. The Node object provides commands to control the Lightning node, such as starting/stopping the node, opening channels, sending payments, and more.\n\nThe code snippet provided demonstrates how to use LDK Node in a Rust program. It sets the network to Testnet, configures the Esplora server and the Gossip Sync server, builds the Node object, and starts the node. It then shows an example of creating a new on-chain address, connecting to another Lightning node, handling events, sending payments, and finally stopping the node.\n\nOverall, LDK Node aims to simplify the process of setting up a self-custodial Lightning node while providing enough flexibility and configurability to meet different needs.",

      "summary": "The provided passage discusses BTC Warp, a solution that aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes to the Bitcoin network. Currently, syncing a full Bitcoin node can take several days due to the large number of blocks and transactions. This delay poses a high barrier of entry for new nodes and users. BTC Warp, using succinct, verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers, offers a way to instantly sync to the Bitcoin network with significantly less storage.\n\nBTC Warp focuses on light nodes, which can connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without participating in consensus or storing the full chain history. Light nodes allow participants to utilize the network without requiring extensive networking and hardware resources. Examples of light nodes include phones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts.\n\nTo establish a trustless way of knowing the state of and interacting with the BTC chain, light nodes play a key role in verifying the proof-of-work (PoW) and querying other nodes for data. However, due to the size of the BTC chain, most users rely on centralized systems instead of using light clients.\n\nBTC Warp addresses the issue of sync time and computational requirements by utilizing zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). zkSNARKs allow for the generation of a proof that a certain computation (in this case, syncing a light client) has a specific output, while the proof can be verified quickly, even if the computation itself takes a long time.\n\nThe BTC Warp solution involves implementing syncing algorithms inside a zkSNARK to generate a succinct proof of validity for a specific header with a certain amount of work associated with it. By using zkSNARKs, the proof size is reduced to less than 30 kB, allowing new light clients to instantly verify the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain. The ultimate goal is to SNARK the full Bitcoin blockchain for full nodes, with light nodes being the first step in the process.\n\nTo address the challenge of the size of the BTC chain, which contains over 780,000 blocks, recursive SNARKs are used. Recursive SNARKs enable parallelization of proof generation, improving scalability, compute efficiency, and reducing centralization. To implement recursive SNARKs, the Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system from Polygon is used.\n\nA tree structure is utilized for the BTC Warp proof tree, where each layer of the tree has a different circuit. The tree structure allows for faster and cheaper generation of the initial proof, as each layer can prove a sequence of headers. However, the current construction of the proof tree has a limitation in that it can only prove up to a certain block. To address this, a modification is made to the circuits to accommodate new blocks while still maintaining compatibility with existing proofs.\n\nThe BTC block headers are obtained using the Nakamoto light client, which is written in Rust. The Nakamoto light client library allows for easy retrieval of block headers and listening to network gossip for updates. When new blocks are detected, a Fargate instance is spawned to update the proof tree. Optimization techniques, such as circuit serialization, are explored to reduce proof generation costs and time.\n\nBTC Warp aims to achieve full-state proving for Bitcoin, allowing for the instant verification of all Bitcoin blocks. However, a bottleneck exists in the size of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) in a block, which requires significant storage. The use of Utreexo and other efficient data structures within a zkSNARK is considered to address this issue.\n\nIn addition to addressing the sync problem, BTC Warp also explores potential use cases for zero-shot sync BTC. Examples include applications where instant syncing can enhance user experience or scenarios where trustless verification is critical. The BTC Warp team is open to collaboration and encourages developers with relevant experience to join their team. They also offer their underlying primitives for potential use in other blockchain ecosystems or applications.",
      "summaryeli15": "BTC Warp is a project that aims to solve the problem of synchronizing light nodes with the Bitcoin network. Currently, new nodes and users can take several days to sync a full Bitcoin node by downloading and verifying the entire chain's history of work. This process is time-consuming and energy-intensive, and it poses a high barrier of entry due to hardware and network requirements. BTC Warp offers a solution to instantly sync to the Bitcoin network.\n\nBTC Warp utilizes zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to provide a verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers. These proofs allow new light clients to verify the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain with significantly less storage (less than 30 kB) compared to the storage required for storing all block headers (over 60 MB).\n\nTo understand the need for light nodes, it is essential to understand the different types of Bitcoin nodes. There are three types: full nodes, light nodes, and miner nodes. Full nodes store the entire blockchain, participate in consensus, and validate all transactions. Light nodes, on the other hand, can connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without participating in consensus or storing the full chain history. They provide a way for participants to utilize the network without steep networking and hardware requirements. Light nodes can be used by phones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts to interact with the chain easily.\n\nHowever, even with the benefits light nodes offer, most users today rely on centralized systems instead of using light clients. One of the primary challenges is the size of the Bitcoin chain, which makes syncing time-consuming and computation-heavy. BTC Warp aims to address this challenge by using zkSNARKs to generate succinct proofs of validity for block headers, allowing for instant synchronization of light clients.\n\nTo achieve this, BTC Warp implements the Bitcoin syncing algorithm within a zkSNARK. The algorithm verifies that a given header and its previous header form a chain and increments the total work by the work in the current header. This process is repeated for all headers, allowing for the calculation of the total work of the Bitcoin chain.\n\nHowever, the size of the Bitcoin chain presents a new challenge. A circuit can only fit a certain number of SHA computations, and BTC Warp needs to calculate over 1.5 million SHA computations. To overcome this limitation, BTC Warp utilizes recursive SNARKs, which are SNARKs that can verify other SNARKs. This allows for parallelizing proof generation, improving scalability, compute efficiency, and reducing centralization. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system is used in BTC Warp due to its benefits, such as faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nWith recursive SNARKs, BTC Warp creates a \"proof tree\" with different layers, where each layer has a different circuit. The leaf layer verifies the validity of block headers, and each non-leaf layer combines the information from its children nodes. This allows for parallelization, as each layer's circuit can prove a sequence of headers. The challenge is that the proof tree can only prove up to a certain block, and once new blocks are produced beyond that limit, resyncing is required.\n\nTo address this challenge, BTC Warp uses a composable tree approach. This approach enables faster and cheaper generation of the initial proof, as well as guarantees for blocks that are produced in the future. However, to prove future block headers, modifications to the circuit are needed. One modification is that the parent hash of a header is constrained to be the same as the hash of the previous header, ensuring a valid proof.\n\nBTC Warp also requires a way to obtain Bitcoin block headers and generate the proofs. The Nakamoto light client is used to obtain block headers, and a Rust-based light client library called Nakamoto is utilized for this purpose. The light client listens to network gossip to update the proof for new blocks. Additionally, optimizations and benchmarking are performed to determine the most efficient way to generate proofs, taking into account factors like the optimal depth of the tree and the number of headers to prove in a sequence.\n\nBTC Warp's proof generation process involves spawning a Fargate instance to update the proof tree when new blocks are detected. The full infrastructure flow starts from Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) gossip and ends with the user retrieving a BTC Warp proof.\n\nFurther improvements can be made in circuit serialization to reduce the time taken for proof generation. By serializing the circuit once and deserializing it multiple times, the cost of creating a prover can be minimized. Additionally, AWS Fargate resource limitations are identified as a bottleneck, and further testing and parameter tuning can optimize proof generation time and costs.\n\nBTC Warp's ultimate goal is to achieve full-state proving for Bitcoin, allowing for the instant verification of all Bitcoin blocks. However, challenges such as the size of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) in a block need to be addressed. Efficient data structures like Utreexo are considered to overcome this challenge.\n\nBTC Warp also explores potential use cases for its zero shot sync BTC solution. These use cases include improving the scalability and efficiency of the Bitcoin network, enabling trustless Interoperability between Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems, and offering secure and private off-chain transactions.\n\nIn conclusion, BTC Warp aims to solve the problem of light node synchronization with the Bitcoin network by utilizing zkSNARKs and recursive SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of block headers' validity. This approach allows for instant synchronization with significantly less storage requirements. BTC Warp's proof generation process involves verifying block headers within a zkSNARK circuit, using a composable tree approach, and optimizing performance through parallelization and circuit serialization. The project's efforts are focused on achieving full-state proving for Bitcoin and exploring potential use cases for zero shot sync BTC.",

      "summary": "This abstract discusses the fee differences between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees that one may expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. It introduces the concept of out-of-band fees as a potential explanation for these differences and notes that there is evidence suggesting that the recent apparent increase in these differences may not be as significant as some people may suspect.\n\nTo begin, the abstract mentions that there are differences between the fees observed in actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees predicted by a local Bitcoin Core node. The term \"block template\" is used to refer to the fees that the local node expects to be in a block. The differences between the actual fees and the block template fees are calculated and represented in a chart, which shows the percentage of total fees for each block.\n\nThe abstract highlights the problem of sending transactions directly to a miner, as it can slow down block propagation between mining pools. This is because compact blocks, which are a method of block propagation, do not work efficiently when intermediate nodes are unaware of a transaction. Slow propagation creates centralization pressure, which means that block production becomes more centralized. However, this is less of a problem if the transaction is standard and pays enough fee to be included in all mempools, and the out-of-band payment is only used to add a higher fee for faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that out-of-band fees should ideally not exist because the memory pool is meant to be an open competitive fee marketplace. However, it notes that out-of-band fees may be popular for several reasons, including the need for faster inclusion, the desire to bypass competitive fee selection, and the complexity of creating a decentralized fee market.\n\nThe abstract concludes by stating that out-of-band fees are unlikely to be totally eliminated and may be inevitable and unstoppable. However, it suggests that there is still work to be done in terms of education, wallet development, and Bitcoin Core transaction selection policy to minimize the potential need for out-of-band fees.\n\nThe abstract then mentions the launch of a website called miningpool.observer, which aims to detect transaction censorship and displays a candidate block from a local instance of Bitcoin Core for each block produced by miners. The fee difference between the local candidate block and the actual mined block is analyzed as a key metric.\n\nThe abstract notes that another website, Mempool.space, has also added a similar feature called \"Audit\" to display the fee differences between actual blocks and block templates. It mentions that there have been comments suggesting an increase in positive differences (actual blocks containing more fees than block templates) but suggests that this spike may be due to a bug, which has been fixed.\n\nThe abstract includes several charts to visualize the fee differences and other relevant data. It shows the fee differences in actual blocks versus block templates, the Bitcoin fees per block, and the fee differences by mining pool.\n\nOverall, the abstract highlights the ongoing issue of fee differences between actual Bitcoin blocks and block templates, discusses the potential reasons for out-of-band fees, and emphasizes the need for further work to minimize the reliance on such fees.",

It suggests that the evidence for increases in out of band fees may be limited.\n\nThe abstract also touches on the problem of sending transactions directly to a miner, as it can slow down block propagation between mining pools. When intermediate nodes don't know about a transaction, compact blocks don't work efficiently, which creates centralization pressure.

However, it is acknowledged that out of band fees may be popular for various reasons, such as avoiding transaction censorship, prioritizing transactions, or gaining faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract concludes that out of band fees may be inevitable and unstoppable, but efforts can be made to minimize their potential opportunity through education, wallet development, and Bitcoin Core transaction selection policy.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show charts comparing miner fees in actual blocks vs block templates. The charts indicate the differences in fees, with positive numbers indicating that actual block fees are higher than block template fees. The data used for the block templates is from one Bitcoin node run by Sjors Provoost.\n\nFigure 3 shows the rapid increase in Bitcoin fees per block, which may be attributed to Ordinals and \"BRC-20\" tokens boosting demand for block space. This increased activity may have also led to larger memory pools, making it harder for some mining pools to keep up.\n\nFigures 4, 5, and 6 provide more detailed breakdowns of miner fees by pool, comparing actual blocks vs block templates. These charts show the percentage of total fees and indicate whether the actual block fees are higher or lower than the block template fees. The data for the block templates is from the same Bitcoin node run by Sjors Provoost, and the charts are constructed using Google Sheets.\n\nOverall, the abstract and accompanying figures provide analysis and insights into the differences in fees between actual Bitcoin blocks and block templates, as well as the potential role of out of band fees in these differences.",

      "summary": "FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is a cryptographic protocol that involves multiple parties in the generation of a distributed key. Each party generates a secret polynomial and shares evaluations of this polynomial with the other parties. The goal is to create a joint polynomial that represents the final FROST key, with the jointly shared secret being the x=0 intercept of this polynomial.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials, denoted as T-1, determines the threshold T of the multisignature. The threshold represents the number of points required to interpolate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret. In other words, the joint secret can be derived by collecting a sufficient number of evaluations from the participants.\n\nOne interesting aspect of FROST is that parties can interact and perform operations without reconstructing the secret in isolation. This is different from other cryptographic protocols like Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret needs to be reconstructed.\n\nThe question raised is whether it is possible to change the number of signers (N) and the threshold (T) after the key generation process has been completed. Moreover, can these changes be made with a threshold number of signers instead of requiring the consent of all N signers? This scenario is relevant in situations where a FROST secret keyshare is lost and needs to be reissued.\n\nTo address this question, the authors explore existing ideas from the secret sharing literature. One approach is to turn a t-of-n threshold into a (t-of-n-1) threshold by trusting one user to delete their secret keyshare. It is important to ensure that n > t to maintain the required threshold. However, if the party cannot be reliably trusted to delete their keyshare, further measures can be taken to render the revoked keyshares incompatible with future multisignature participants.\n\nOne possible solution is to use proactive secret sharing, where shares are periodically renewed without changing the secret. This ensures that any information gained by an adversary in one time period becomes useless after the shares are renewed. By employing this technique, a new joint polynomial with the same public key and joint-secret can be created. Then, all n-1 participants are asked to delete their old secret keyshares, resulting in a new set of keyshares that are different and incompatible with the previous ones.\n\nThe threshold can also be decreased by sharing a secret of a single party with all other signers, allowing them to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively reduces the threshold from a t-of-n to a (t-1)-of-(n-1). If it is necessary to keep the number of signers (N) the same while decreasing the threshold, a new secret keyshare can be issued and distributed to all other signers. This transition from a t-of-n to a (t-1)-of-n threshold requires some coordination to ensure that the secret reaches all participants fairly.\n\nIn more adversarial scenarios, additional steps can be taken to manage a fair exchange of the secret. Ensuring that the new secret gets distributed to all participants can be achieved through various techniques.\n\nEnrollment protocols provide another approach to add or recover a party without redoing the key generation process. These protocols allow for the evaluation of the joint polynomial at a new participant index and the secure sharing of a new secret keyshare with the new participant. This ensures that the new party can participate in FROST signing without requiring a complete redo of the key generation.\n\nAn alternative method involves modifying the original key generation process to include the evaluation of secret scalar polynomials for future signers. By including the calculations for additional secret shares, new signers can be added later on. However, this requires the participation of all N signers and their agreement to add the new signer. This method is not suitable for scenarios involving lost FROST devices or uncooperative signers.\n\nThe authors also mention the possibility of distributing these secret shares for redundancy. However, it is not straightforward to share these secret shares without risking the premature creation of additional signers. One potential solution is to use Shamir Secret Sharing to distribute fragments of secret shares. To issue a new signer, T signers need to send all the fragments they hold that belong to the new index. By collecting at least T x N fragments, it is possible to recreate N secret shares, resulting in a new signer with their own point on the joint polynomial.\n\nThe implementation of these ideas is still exploratory, and some details need to be further investigated. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that the mentioned methods might have already been studied and implemented in the secret sharing literature, but they may come with caveats and additional considerations.\n\nOverall, the FROST protocol offers flexibility in terms of adjusting the number of signers and the threshold after the initial key generation. These adjustments can be made with a threshold number of signers, allowing for the reissuance of FROST secret keyshares or the addition of new signers relying on the existing setup.",
      "summaryeli15": "FROST's distributed key generation is a process that involves multiple parties (let's call them N parties) each creating a secret polynomial. A polynomial is a mathematical function that involves variables raised to different powers. The parties then share evaluations of their polynomials with each other to create a distributed FROST key.\n\nThe final FROST key is described by a joint polynomial, which is a polynomial that combines the contributions of all parties involved. The x=0 intercept of this polynomial represents the jointly shared secret, denoted as s=f(0). Each participant has control over a single point on this polynomial based on their participant index.\n\nThe degree of the polynomials (T-1) determines the threshold T of the multisignature. This threshold represents the minimum number of points required to reconstruct the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret. In other words, T parties need to work together to interpolate evaluations without actually reconstructing the secret in isolation, unlike Shamir Secret Sharing where the secret needs to be reconstructed.\n\nNow, the interesting question arises: Is it possible to change the number of signers (N) and the threshold (T) after the key generation process has been completed? And can these changes be made with the agreement of a threshold number of signers instead of requiring the consent of all N signers? Let's explore some potential solutions.\n\nOne approach is to decrease the threshold from T to (T-1) if we can trust one user to delete their secret keyshare. To ensure this, it is important to make sure that the number of participants (N) is larger than the threshold (T), so if one party deletes their keyshare, we can still meet the threshold requirement. However, this method relies on the trustworthiness of the party deleting their keyshare.\n\nAlternatively, if we cannot rely on the party to delete their secret keyshare, we can make the revoked keyshares incompatible with future participants. This can be achieved through proactive secret sharing. Proactive secret sharing involves periodically renewing the shares without changing the secret in a way that renders any information gained by an adversary useless for attacking the secret after the shares are renewed.\n\nTo create a new joint polynomial with the same public key and joint secret, we can redo the key generation process with n-1 parties. Each participant uses the same first coefficient in their original keygen polynomial, while the other terms are generated randomly. This will result in a new polynomial with the same joint secret but different points that are incompatible with the previous keyshares.\n\nWe can also decrease the threshold by sharing a secret of a single party to all other signers, enabling them to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively transforms a T of N into a (T-1) of (N-1). If we also know how to increase the number of signers, we can issue a brand new secret keyshare and distribute it to all other signers, transitioning from a T of N to a (T-1) of N.\n\nIn more adversarial multisignature scenarios, steps could be taken to manage a fair exchange of this secret to ensure it reaches all participants securely.\n\nIt is also advised to back up individual secret keyshares, although backups are not the same as issuing an additional party who can contribute an independent signature share towards the threshold. Issuing new signers involves additional complexity.\n\nNow, let's explore the process of adding a new participant without redoing the key generation. Enrollment protocols can be used for this purpose. These protocols allow us to repair or add a new party without redoing the key generation process. In this process, a threshold number of parties collaborate to evaluate the joint polynomial at a new participant index and securely share this new secret keyshare with the new participant. This enables the new participant to contribute to the FROST signing process.\n\nAnother method involves modifying the key generation process to generate extra secret shares during the initial keygen phase. These extra secret shares can be later used to issue new signers. However, adding a new signer requires the consent and participation of all N signers, making it impractical in cases where a signer is lost or uncooperative.\n\nTo address this limitation, the idea of distributing these secret shares for redundancy is considered. However, simply sharing these secret shares introduces a risk of creating additional signers prematurely if a party obtains shares at some index from all signers. To mitigate this risk, the secret shares can be Shamir secret shared, introducing a threshold requirement once again. Fragments of secret shares can be distributed among the signers.\n\nTo issue a new signer, T signers need to send all the fragments they hold that belong to the index of the new signer. By recovering at least T x N fragments, N secret shares can be recreated and collected to form a long-lived secret keyshare, enabling the new signer to have their own point on the joint polynomial.\n\nIt is worth noting that increasing the threshold from T to a higher value seems to be more challenging than redoing the key generation process. It would require the group to increase the degree of the polynomial and trust everyone to delete the old one.\n\nThis detailed explanation is intended to provide an in-depth understanding of FROST's distributed key generation and the possibilities for changing the number of signers and the threshold after key generation. It is important to conduct further research and investigation into the most appropriate and secure methods mentioned here, as well as to consider any potential limitations or caveats that may arise.",

It is essential to note that opting for an excessively large number of participants may increase the likelihood of failure. Failure can occur due to dropped connections or missed messages in the simulation. Additionally, choosing an extremely large number of participants might even cause your browser to crash.

Number of People: You need to specify how many people you want to participate in this transaction simulation. Keep in mind that if the number is too large, there is a higher chance of failure. This can happen due to dropped connections or missed messages. Also, having a very large number of participants might even crash your browser. So, it's recommended to start with a conservative number.\n\n6. Testnet Bitcoin Address: You need to provide a testnet bitcoin address where the fake money should go after the demo. This is the address where the bitcoins will be received during the simulation.\n\nTo summarize, you are using the testnet to simulate a bitcoin transaction where a large group of people will send fake money to one bitcoin address. The goal is to make it appear as if only one person sent the bitcoins. You need to specify the number of participants for the simulation and provide a testnet bitcoin address to receive the fake money.",

      "summary": "ACINQ is a developer and operator of the Lightning Network, which is an open payment network built on top of Bitcoin. The Lightning Network allows for fast and scalable transactions, but it also poses security challenges, particularly when it comes to protecting private keys.\n\nTo address this, ACINQ has spent years researching and developing a solution to secure their Lightning node. They have settled on a combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano devices. AWS Nitro Enclaves provide an isolated compute environment, while Ledger Nano is a hardware device with a trusted display for signing transactions.\n\nOperating a Lightning node involves managing private keys that control funds, making it a prime target for hackers. Depending on the activity of the node operator, the funds at risk may belong to the operator or the users. ACINQ operates a routing node and self-custodial wallet provider, so their own funds are at risk.\n\nACINQ has developed an open-source Lightning implementation called Eclair, which is designed for large workloads. It is written in Scala and runs on the JVM. Eclair powers the ACINQ node, which manages a significant amount of BTC and channels. ACINQ expects these numbers to grow in the future, along with the associated security risks.\n\nInitially, ACINQ planned to use an off-the-shelf Hardware Security Module (HSM) to secure their node. However, they discovered that AWS Nitro Enclaves offered a superior solution for their needs. They changed their course and designed a solution that combines Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano devices. This setup provides a good trade-off between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity for running a professional Lightning node.\n\nThe Lightning Network consists of payment channels that allow nodes to relay payments. When a payment is made from node A to node D through nodes B and C, it is actually split into sub-payments from A to B, B to C, and C to D. The Lightning protocol ensures that all sub-payments either succeed or fail together. ACINQ operates as a routing node, forwarding payments rather than sending or receiving them directly.\n\nSecuring a Lightning node is not simply a matter of protecting private keys. While hardware is typically the best solution for protecting cryptographic keys, ACINQ faces challenges because their node runs on AWS. They need to self-host their private keys but also maintain the flexibility provided by a cloud provider. As a result, they split their deployment in order to leverage the benefits of both approaches.\n\nHowever, simply having the HSM sign whatever Eclair sends to it is not sufficient. The compromised nature of the servers means that there needs to be context attached to the signing process. ACINQ had to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSM to ensure it understands what a Lightning payment is.\n\nDeveloping an HSM application for this purpose is difficult, as HSMs have specific proprietary features and memory constraints. ACINQ had to store encrypted data on the HSM's host filesystem and pass it back and forth for each payment sub-step. This added complexity and operational burden to their deployment.\n\nThe HSM also needs knowledge of the blockchain to authenticate channels. If this authentication is not done correctly, an attacker could drain ACINQ's wallet by feeding the HSM with fake payments. Authenticating channels turned out to be more complex than initially anticipated, as there are various corner cases to consider.\n\nAfter implementing a complete HSM application, ACINQ achieved a high level of security. However, it came at the cost of increased complexity, high development and maintenance costs, and limited performance compared to high-end servers.\n\nTraditional trusted runtimes, including Trusted Execution Environments (T.E.Es), were not designed to handle the complexity of the Lightning protocol. ACINQ mentions a trend towards implementing Confidential Computing Environments that allow running complex applications inside secure runtimes without splitting them between trusted and untrusted parts. This approach offers better consistency, limited custom development, and simpler operations.\n\nACINQ chose to use AWS Nitro Enclaves, which are secure runtime environments that can run any application and do not require programming against specific libraries. Nitro Enclaves allow Eclair to run securely and connect to the internet through TCP sockets.\n\nTo further enhance security, ACINQ built a secure \"master\" repository for secrets using Nitro Enclaves. They leverage Nitro Attestations to establish secure tunnels between their application and the master repository. Secrets are encrypted and injected into the master repository using an air-gapped machine. When the Lightning node starts, it establishes a secure tunnel with the master enclave to retrieve its secrets.\n\nACINQ also uses Ledger Nano devices to enhance security. The trusted display on the Ledger device allows administrators to sign sensitive operations, such as signing a new application package or starting and stopping the Lightning node. The Ledger devices are securely connected to the Nitro Enclave's host through tunnels, and the signatures are checked inside the Nitro Enclave.\n\nACINQ has developed a custom Ledger application that runs on the Ledger devices they use. The Ledger devices are also used to sign application packages, ensuring they have not been tampered with. Multiple developers independently build the application to protect against supply chain attacks.\n\nThe image deployed inside the Nitro Enclave is a \"launcher\" application, which decouples the lifecycle of the Nitro Enclave image from the lifecycle of Eclair. Upgrading Eclair only requires signing a new application package with a trusted Ledger device and does not require physical access to the air-gapped machine.\n\nACINQ has also ensured that Bitcoin Core benefits from the security provided by Nitro Enclaves. Monitoring the Bitcoin blockchain is done by Eclair inside a Nitro Enclave, verifying transactions and detecting any attempts to manipulate bitcoin data. Eclair connects to different Bitcoin data sources to verify the main bitcoin node's sync with the Bitcoin network, protecting against eclipse attacks.\n\nFrom a provisioning and performance perspective, ACINQ's Lightning node runs on the same type of servers with the same performance as before implementing Nitro Enclaves. The maintainability of their application is also unaffected, as their developers and the Nitro toolkits are separate projects.\n\nThe solution built by ACINQ using AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger hardware wallets offers a balance between security, cost, and maintainability. It allows them to protect their working capital and perform operational tasks with ease. The solution is not tied to AWS and can be replicated on other platforms deploying Confidential Computing Environments.\n\nOverall, ACINQ's approach demonstrates their commitment to securing their Lightning node and addressing the challenges posed by operating such a node. Their thorough consideration of security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity has resulted in a comprehensive solution that is adaptable to future needs and potentially transferable to other platforms.",
      "summaryeli15": "ACINQ is a company that is heavily involved in the development and operation of the Lightning Network, which is a payment network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, operating a Lightning Network node comes with significant security challenges because the private keys used to control the funds need to be online and accessible, making them susceptible to hacking.\n\nTo address this issue, ACINQ has spent years researching and developing a solution to secure their Lightning node. They have chosen to use a combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves (an isolated computing environment) and Ledger Nano (a hardware device with secure display) to achieve the best trade-off between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity for running a professional Lightning node.\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to be a fast, scalable, and open network of nodes that facilitate payment transactions. These nodes are connected to the Internet, process transactions in real-time, and manage private keys that control the funds. However, because Lightning nodes are essentially hot wallets, they are prime targets for hackers.\n\nThe level of risk for a Lightning node depends on the activity of the operator. In the case of exchanges or custodial wallets, the funds at risk belong to the users. In ACINQ's case, as a routing node and self-custodial wallet provider, their own funds are at risk.\n\nACINQ has developed an open-source Lightning implementation called Eclair, which is designed to handle large workloads. Eclair is written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It uses the actor model, which allows it to scale to a large number of payment channels and handle high transaction volumes.\n\nEclair powers the ACINQ node, which currently manages a significant amount of Bitcoin and a large number of channels. ACINQ expects these numbers to grow significantly in the future, so they recognized the critical importance of security early on and invested in researching solutions about four years ago.\n\nInitially, ACINQ developed a full Lightning implementation for a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is a hardware device used to protect cryptographic keys. This solution worked, but they later discovered that AWS Nitro Enclaves offered a superior solution for their use case. They changed their approach and designed an original solution that incorporates a Ledger Nano device for some authentication operations. They are now successfully running Eclair on Nitro Enclaves in their production environment.\n\nThe Lightning Network operates through payment channels, which are anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain. Payments made through these channels do not need to be recorded on the blockchain, allowing for a high throughput. When a payment is made from node A to node D through nodes B and C, the Lightning protocol ensures that all sub-payments either succeed or fail together. Nodes B and C, known as routing nodes, act as intermediaries in the payment process.\n\nSecuring a Lightning node is not as simple as just protecting private keys. While hardware-based solutions like HSMs are ideal for protecting cryptographic keys, they cannot be directly used with AWS servers. ACINQ needs the flexibility offered by AWS, so their deployment is split into two parts: Eclair runs on their own self-hosted infrastructure, while the HSMs are used for secure key management.\n\nTo ensure that the HSMs cannot blindly sign any request from Eclair, context needs to be attached. ACINQ had to implement a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSMs, which was challenging due to the proprietary OS, runtime, system, and cryptographic APIs of the HSMs. Additionally, HSMs have limited memory and no local storage, which posed constraints for a stateful protocol like Lightning.\n\nACINQ had to encrypt and store all the necessary data on the HSMs' host filesystem, resulting in a complex deployment with multiple logical parts. However, simply using HSMs to secure private keys was not enough. To authenticate channels and ensure the validity of payments, the HSMs needed access to the Bitcoin blockchain, the ultimate source of truth. Implementing this functionality turned out to be more complicated than anticipated.\n\nAfter investing significant time and effort, ACINQ developed a complete application for the HSMs to implement most of the Lightning protocol. While this achieved a high level of security, it came with added complexity and operational burden. The software for the HSMs was larger than expected, resulting in higher development and maintenance costs. Additionally, the deployment was split into disjointed parts, which made basic operations like restarts and upgrades risky. The performance of HSMs was also limited compared to high-end servers.\n\nTraditional trusted runtimes, including Trusted Execution Environments, were not originally designed for complex applications like Lightning. ACINQ discovered a trend of implementing Confidential Computing Environments that enable running entire applications inside secure runtimes, which seemed to offer a better approach.\n\nConfidential Computing Environments, like AWS Nitro Enclaves, eliminate the need to trust the cloud provider. ACINQ chose Nitro Enclaves because they could run any application and did not require programming against specific libraries. They created a \"LINK\" protocol to manage network connections between the enclave and external destinations. This allowed Eclair to run in a Nitro Enclave and connect to the Internet.\n\nTo protect their secrets, ACINQ used Nitro Enclaves to establish a secure \"master\" repository where secrets are securely stored. Secrets are package into encrypted blobs using an air-gapped machine and decrypted in the master enclave. When the Lightning node starts, it establishes a secure tunnel to the master enclave and retrieves its secrets.\n\nTo further enhance security, ACINQ relies on Ledger devices, which have trusted displays, to handle sensitive operations. Ledger devices are used to sign operations like application deployment or management API calls. ACINQ developed a custom Ledger application that runs on trusted devices, and administrators use their Ledger devices to validate and sign operations. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures that critical tasks cannot be bypassed.\n\nACINQ also whitelists and trusts different Ledger devices for different purposes, such as application deployment and management. Administrators can securely sign and deploy application packages using their Ledger devices, which prevents supply chain attacks. Additionally, tools and processes are in place to ensure consistency, determinism, and ease of deployment and upgrade.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core does not run inside a Nitro Enclave, ACINQ leverages the security provided by Eclair running in the enclave. Eclair can cryptographically verify transactions, monitor the Bitcoin blockchain, and protect against eclipse attacks. The deployment and upgrade process for Eclair remains similar to the pre-Nitro setup, with the added benefit of enhanced security.\n\nACINQ has achieved a secure and maintainable Lightning node deployment by combining AWS Nitro Enclaves with Ledger devices. They have built multiple layers of security tools and processes, and the reliance on Nitro Enclaves allows them to easily switch to other cloud providers that offer Confidential Computing Environments. The security, cost, and maintainability trade-offs provided by this solution make it the best fit for ACINQ's needs.",

An API to issue and manage digital assets on the Liquid Network:\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. This specific API is designed to enable the issuance and management of digital assets (like cryptocurrencies) on the Liquid Network, which is a Bitcoin sidechain.\n\n2.

      "summary": "The concept being explained here is the implementation of a two-way peg bridging Bitcoin (BTC) to other blockchains. This bridging mechanism is different from a typical one-way peg, where BTC is burned and cannot be retrieved. Instead, in this case, the BTC is locked up for a specific period of time, which is 20 years.\n\nDuring this lock-up period, the community needs to devise a method to perform peg-outs, which refers to the process of transferring BTC from the locked state back to the original blockchain or another chain. This can potentially be achieved through the use of a feature called OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity, which are scripting languages or functionalities within the blockchain system.\n\nTo enable this functionality, the developers propose using an opcode called OP_ZKP_VERIFY, which would be created based on the OP_NOP10 opcode. In the script, BTC holders can lock their coins utilizing this opcode. The precise implementation of the OP_ZKP_VERIFY is designed to read the values from the stack, which contains data provided in the unlocking script.\n\nThe main objective of this design is to create a system where the more BTC is locked up using this script, the greater the incentive for individuals or the community to come up with a solution for performing the peg-outs. Essentially, the larger the amount of locked BTC, the more valuable it becomes to solve the problem of unlocking them.\n\nThis concept of a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains was initially developed by Burak, with contributions from Super Testnet and someone referred to as \"I\". They worked together to refine and document the idea. The mention of Jeremy Rubin's idea about betting on Taproot activation suggests a similar concept of incentivizing participation through the locking of BTC.\n\nThe provided script includes the opcodes OP_NOP10, OP_CLTV, and OP_2DROP. However, without further context or explanation, it is difficult to determine how these opcodes specifically fit into the overall mechanism or functionality being described.",
      "summaryeli15": "I understand that you would like me to explain the concept of a two-way peg bridging Bitcoin (BTC) to other chains in great detail, as if you were a 15-year-old. I will break it down for you step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a peg is. In this context, a peg refers to connecting or linking two different blockchain networks together. It allows for the transfer of assets, like BTC, from one blockchain to another.\n\nNow, a two-way peg specifically refers to a mechanism that allows BTC to be moved between the Bitcoin blockchain and other chains in both directions. This means that BTC can be transferred from the Bitcoin network to other chains, and vice versa.\n\nIn this particular case, the two-way peg works similarly to a perpetual one-way peg, but with a slight modification. Usually, in a one-way peg, BTC is burned or destroyed on the Bitcoin network when it is moved to another chain. However, in this case, instead of burning or destroying the BTC, it is locked up for a specific period of time, which in this example is 20 years.\n\nDuring these 20 years, the community, or a group of people supporting this pegging mechanism, needs to come up with a way to enable the transfer of BTC back from the other chains to the Bitcoin network. This process is called peg-out.\n\nTo enable this peg-out process, the community has to find a solution using tools like OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity. OP_ZKP_VERIFY is a hypothetical operation code, and in this case, it is being used to represent a desired operation code OP_NOP10, which is a no-operation code in Bitcoin scripting.\n\nThe idea is to design this OP_ZKP_VERIFY operation code in such a way that it reads information or data (represented as stack) from the script being used to unlock it. This data could be something like proof that the BTC being transferred back to the Bitcoin network originated from the locked BTC.\n\nThe more BTC that is locked in this script, the greater the incentive for people to solve this peg-out problem. In other words, if there are a significant number of BTC locked up, it becomes more worthwhile for the community to find a solution and enable the transfer of these BTC back to the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis concept was developed by someone named Burak, with input and assistance from individuals referred to as \"Super Testnet\" and \"I.\" They worked together to flesh out and document this idea. It is worth mentioning that this idea bears some resemblance to a concept proposed by Jeremy Rubin, which involves betting on Taproot activation. Taproot is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nTo summarize, a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains is a mechanism that allows for the transfer of BTC between different blockchain networks. Instead of burning BTC, it is locked up for a specific time period. The community must come up with a solution to enable the transfer of these locked BTC back to the Bitcoin network using techniques like OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity. The more BTC locked in this script, the higher the motivation to solve the peg-out problem. The concept was developed collaboratively by Burak, with support from \"Super Testnet\" and \"I,\" and it is similar to Jeremy Rubin's proposal related to Taproot activation.",
