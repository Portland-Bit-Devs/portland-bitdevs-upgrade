      "summary": "This message is an announcement from Michael Ford, who is a contributor to the Bitcoin development community. He is informing the recipients that Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available for download. The software can be obtained from the official Bitcoin Core website at https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/.\n\nIn addition to the official website, the software can also be accessed on GitHub through a repository owned by Peter Todd. To clone the repository and obtain the software, users can execute the following command: \"git clone -b full-rbf-v25.0 https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git\".\n\nSo, what exactly is this software? It is Bitcoin Core v25.0, but it includes a specific feature called \"full-replace-by-fee\" (full-rbf) code developed by Antoine Riard. This new feature allows for more flexibility in transaction fee management and improves the user experience. The version being released includes additional minor updates on top of the full-rbf code.\n\nThe primary purpose of the full-rbf code is twofold. Firstly, when the configuration option \"mempoolfullrbf\" is set to 1, the software will advertise itself as a node supporting full-replace-by-fee. This means that other nodes in the network will be aware that this node supports full-rbf functionality. Secondly, the software will actively connect to four additional nodes that also support full-rbf. This ensures that there is a core group of nodes that reliably propagate full-rbf transaction replacements throughout the network.\n\nIt is worth noting that not everyone needs to run this specific version of the Bitcoin Core software. However, it would be beneficial if more people adopted it. To understand the reasons why full-replace-by-fee is valuable, Michael Ford suggests reading a blog post by Peter Todd titled \"Why You Should Run mempoolfullrbf.\" This blog post provides detailed information on the benefits and use cases of full-rbf.\n\nMichael Ford also includes a playful note about there being hats available regarding this specific feature. He provides a link to a tweet by Peter Todd that showcases these hats.\n\nThe message concludes with Michael Ford's contact information and a non-text attachment, which is a digital signature. The signature helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of the message. The attachment, however, has been scrubbed and is not available in this message.\n\nOverall, this message serves as an announcement for the availability of Bitcoin Core v25.0 with full-replace-by-fee functionality and encourages users to consider adopting it for improved transaction fee management.",
      "summaryeli15": "This message is from Michael Ford, who is discussing the release of Bitcoin Core version v25.0. This version of Bitcoin Core is available for download from the official Bitcoin Core website, as well as from a specific branch on GitHub.\n\nThe specific branch on GitHub is called \"full-rbf-v25.0\" and can be accessed by using the command \"git clone -b full-rbf-v25.0 https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin.git\". This branch includes Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, which is a feature that allows for full-replace-by-fee transactions.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Full-replace-by-fee (full-rbf) is a functionality of Bitcoin Core that allows users to update a transaction that is already in the mempool (the list of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block) by creating a new transaction with a higher fee. This is useful in situations where a user wants to accelerate the confirmation of a transaction or modify the transaction's parameters.\n\nOne of the updates in Bitcoin Core v25.0 with full-rbf is the advertising of a FULL_RBF service bit. When the configuration option \"mempoolfullrbf\" is set to 1, the node will advertise that it supports full-rbf functionality. This helps in identifying nodes that are capable of handling full-rbf transactions.\n\nAdditionally, the update connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. This means that these nodes will communicate and propagate full-rbf transactions among themselves. By doing so, a core group of nodes is established that can reliably handle and propagate full-rbf replacements.\n\nIt's important to note that not everyone needs to run this specific version with full-rbf functionality. However, it would be helpful if more people did so, as it would contribute to the overall strength and reliability of the network.\n\nTo understand why running full-rbf functionality is valuable, you can refer to a blog post by Peter Todd. The blog post discusses the advantages and benefits of using full-rbf and explains why it is recommended.\n\nAs an interesting side note, Peter Todd also mentions that there are hats available related to this update. He shares a link to a tweet showing the hats.\n\nThat concludes the detailed explanation of the message. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!",

      "summary": "The letter is a message from the LNP/BP Standards Association to the Bitcoin community. It discusses the release of the RGB smart contract system and introduces a proposal called Prime to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe RGB smart contract system was previously announced by the LNP/BP Standards Association. It is a system that allows for the creation and management of smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nIn the subsequent discussion, the association references the potential for client-side validation to upgrade the Bitcoin layer 1 blockchain. They believe that the current blockchain is limiting the scalability and privacy of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Client-side validation, which involves validating transactions on the client side rather than on the blockchain, has the potential to address these issues.\n\nThe association proposes Prime as a way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol. Prime is a scalable and fully anonymous layer 1 that can handle up to billions of transactions per minute. It aims to move most of the validation work to the client-side validation system. Importantly, Prime does not affect Bitcoin as money (BTC) or other parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including proof of work (PoW). It can be deployed without a softfork and miners upgrade, but may benefit from them.\n\nThe proposal also states that upgrading to Prime does not require consensus or majority for initial deployment. This means that users who are not willing to upgrade can continue to use the current system without any issues. Additionally, the proposal suggests that Prime would make other layer 2 systems, such as the Lightning Network, redundant.\n\nFurthermore, the proposal highlights that Prime would make certain things like BRC20, inscriptions, and ordinals impossible. These are replaced by RGB smart contracts, which allow for the creation and management of proper assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This approach reduces the burden on non-users who would otherwise have to store, validate, and use their network bandwidth for third-party interests without compensation.\n\nThe association provides a link to a white paper that describes the Prime proposal in detail.\n\nThey also mention that they are forming a working group focused on the formal specification and reference implementation of the new layer. They invite anyone interested in cooperating on this topic to join the working group. Additionally, the association plans to organize educational and workshop activities to help the community better understand the technology underlying Prime and make informed decisions regarding its adoption.\n\nThe association emphasizes that this infrastructural effort should not be driven by a for-profit company or commercial group. They believe that funding for this effort should come from non-profit donations. They plan to launch a fundraising campaign to support the development of Prime. They encourage anyone interested in advancing the evolution of Bitcoin to contact them for more information.\n\nIn conclusion, the letter introduces the Prime proposal as a way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol, making it scalable and fully anonymous. It highlights the benefits of client-side validation and the use of RGB smart contracts. The association seeks cooperation from the community and emphasizes the importance of non-profit funding for this effort.",
      "summaryeli15": "Dear 15-year-old,\n\nThe LNP/BP Standards Association recently released the RGB smart contract system, which aims to improve the Bitcoin blockchain. In the discussion that followed, they mentioned the potential for upgrading the Bitcoin layer 1 - the blockchain itself. This layer is currently causing scalability and privacy issues within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The idea is to introduce client-side validation, which would move most validation work away from the blockchain and into a more efficient system.\n\nThe LNP/BP Association is now presenting a proposal called Prime to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol. This proposal suggests implementing a new layer 1 that is scalable, allowing for billions of transactions per minute. It would also make the layer 1 fully anonymous, ensuring privacy. This upgrade can be deployed without a softfork and doesn't require all users to upgrade at once.\n\nThe proposed upgrade would not affect Bitcoin as money or the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including proof-of-work (PoW). It also makes layer 2 systems like the Lightning Network unnecessary. Additionally, this upgrade would make certain things like BRC20, inscriptions, and ordinals impossible. Instead, assets like NFTs would be handled through RGB smart contracts, eliminating the need for non-users to store, validate, and use their network bandwidth for third-party interests.\n\nYou can find a more detailed explanation of the Prime proposal in the white paper provided at this link: [link to white paper].\n\nThe LNP/BP Standards Association is forming a working group to develop a formal specification and reference implementation for this new layer. They encourage anyone interested to join and cooperate on this topic. They also plan to provide educational and workshop activities to help the community better understand the underlying technology and make informed decisions about its adoption.\n\nThe Association believes that this important effort should not be led by a for-profit company. Instead, they advocate for funding the project through non-profit donations. They are planning a fundraising campaign and encourage those interested in driving the evolution of Bitcoin forward to contact them at ukolova[at]lnp-bp.org.\n\nFor-profit organizations can also become members of the Association and participate in committees that shape future Bitcoin technologies.

      "summary": "This message is proposing a strategy for utilizing the taproot annex, a consensus valid but non-standard feature in the Bitcoin protocol. The conversations around standardizing the taproot annex are leaning towards adopting a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. However, finalizing the exact format may take time. In the meantime, the message suggests making the annex available in a non-structured form to allow developers to use its features without delay.\n\nThe proposal suggests defining any annex that begins with '0' as free-form, without any additional constraints. This approach has several benefits. Firstly, it allows developers to immediately utilize the taproot annex for various applications without waiting for the implementation of a structured format like TLV. Secondly, it keeps the options open for future developments and improvements in the annex's structure. By not setting the structure in stone prematurely, it ensures flexibility as the standardization process progresses.\n\nAnother advantage of using a non-structured format is the potential efficiency gains. Non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a probable TLV format, which would involve encoding the length even when there's only a single field. This can result in more efficient use of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn summary, adopting this approach broadens the utilization scope of the taproot annex immediately, while also preserving the possibility of transitioning to a more structured format in the future. The proposal is seen as pragmatic and efficient, offering benefits in both the short and long term.",
      "summaryeli15": "At the moment, the taproot annex is considered valid according to a certain consensus, but it is not standard. Discussions about standardizing it are leaning towards using a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. This format has a lot of potential, but it might take a long time to settle on a specific format. In the meantime, there are benefits to allowing the taproot annex to be used in a non-structured form without any constraints.\n\nBy allowing developers to use the taproot annex right away, we can take advantage of its features without waiting for a lengthy standardization process. I am suggesting that we define any annex that starts with '0' as free-form, meaning it can be used in any way without additional restrictions. This strategy offers a few benefits:\n\n1. Immediate utilization: Developers can start using the taproot annex for various applications without waiting for the TLV or any other structured format to be implemented.\n\n2. Future flexibility: If we designate '0'-beginning annexes as free-form, we keep our options open for future developments and improvements in structure. This means that as we work on standardizing the annex, we don't limit ourselves by setting its structure too early.\n\n3. Chainspace efficiency: Non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a potential TLV format. The TLV format would require encoding the length even for a single field, while non-structured data can be more compact.\n\nIn conclusion, adopting this approach will broaden the usage of the taproot annex right away while also allowing for a transition to a more structured format in the future. This is a pragmatic and efficient route that can bring significant benefits in both the short and long term.",

      "summary": "The idea proposed in this text is about using out-of-band relay as an alternative way to send transaction packages to miners while peer-to-peer (p2p) package relay is still under development. The author starts by acknowledging that they do not necessarily support this idea, but they find it worth mentioning to stimulate discussion or inspire different use cases.\n\nThe scenario presented involves two transactions, a parent transaction A and a child transaction B. Transaction A is designed to pay 0 satoshi per byte (a hypothetical example, perhaps representing a lightning commitment transaction), while transaction B involves fee bumping, meaning it aims to increase the transaction fee to get confirmed quickly. However, these two transactions cannot reach miners in the current state of p2p package relay.\n\nTo overcome this, the author suggests introducing a third transaction, transaction C. Transaction C would be crafted to include the raw transactions A and B, either in a taproot annex or using a commit/reveal style inscription. The taproot annex method is favored as it is considered simpler and more efficient. Transaction C would pay sufficient fees and use at least one of the same fee-contributing inputs as transaction B, but not any inputs from A.\n\nWhen miners receive transaction C, they could detect the embedded transactions A and B within the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. This transaction package, consisting of A and B, would then replace transaction C and could be included in a block for mining. It is essential to ensure that the combined package of A and B is more attractive to miners than transaction C. The extra weight of the embedded transactions in C helps with this.\n\nAdditionally, it is highlighted that the fees for transaction C will never be paid because it gets replaced. Therefore, there are no extra costs for using this package relay scheme, unless the weight of A and B is very low, and B needs to pay a higher fee rate than necessary to ensure the replacement of C.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that not all miners would adopt this incentive-compatible replacement. In that case, transaction C might still end up being mined. This scenario is less probable if the fee rate for C is kept to a minimum. If transaction C does get mined, the process can be retried with a modified B and C, but the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.\n\nOverall, the author presents this idea as an alternative workaround in the absence of a fully developed p2p package relay system. It is important to note that this explanation provides a detailed interpretation of the author's statement, and it is not a recommendation or endorsement of the proposed idea.",
      "summaryeli15": "There is a concept called out-of-band relay that could be used to get transaction packages to miners more efficiently.

However, there is a workaround that could be implemented.\n\nThe idea is to introduce a third transaction, called C, which contains the raw transactions A and B in a taproot annex. This means that transaction C will include both A and B within it. Alternatively, a commit/reveal style inscription could be used instead, but it would be more complicated and less efficient.\n\nTo ensure that transaction C propagates through the network, it would need to pay sufficient fees. Additionally, transaction C should use at least one of the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B, but not any inputs from transaction A. When miners receive transaction C, they can detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package.\n\nThis transaction package (A+B) would replace transaction C and can be included in a block for mining. It's important to note that the combined package of A+B should be more attractive to miners than transaction C. The embedded transactions in C add extra weight to the package, which makes it more appealing. Also, transaction C will never have its fees paid because it has been replaced.

This method could be more efficient and preferable while p2p package relay is still under development. However, it's worth noting that this idea may have its drawbacks and may not necessarily be supported by everyone in the community.",

      "summary": "In this message, ThomasV proposes an extension to BOLT-11, which is a Lightning Network specification for invoices, to allow for invoices with two bundled payments. He explains that this extension is needed for services that require prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place, specifically mentioning submarine swaps and JIT (Just-In-Time) channels.\n\nIn both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC (Hash Time Lock Contract) for which they do not have the preimage, requiring them to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. Because there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, the service providers need to ask for the prepayment of mining fees.\n\nThomasV highlights that some services, like Loop by Lightning Labs, can ask for prepayment because their software can handle it, but competitors who do not require a dedicated wallet, such as the Boltz exchange, cannot. This creates a vulnerability for Boltz to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where an attacker could force them to pay on-chain fees.\n\nHe also mentions JIT channels, where providers need to protect themselves against this mining fee attack by asking for the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. However, this makes the service custodian and subject to European MICA regulation, which some competitors refuse to offer.\n\nTo address these issues, ThomasV suggests bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. He describes the semantics of bundled payments as follows:\n\n1. The BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment.\n2. The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a Multi-Path Payment (MPP) timeout.\n3. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. The main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.\n\nThomasV acknowledges that this proposal does not prevent a service provider from stealing the pre-payment, but he believes this is already possible in the current setup. He argues that this change would level the playing field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. It would enable those without an established user base running a dedicated client (like Loop) to protect themselves from the mining fee attack.\n\nThomasV also believes ACINQ, another Lightning Network service provider, would benefit from this change as it would make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. He points out that the current form of ACINQ's pay-to-open service falls under the scope of the European MICA regulation, which they should consider a serious issue.\n\nLastly, ThomasV suggests implementing this change in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. He argues against adding new messages when the proposed functionality can be achieved in a non-interactive way.\n\nOverall, ThomasV provides a detailed explanation and rationale for his proposal to extend BOLT-11 to support invoices with bundled payments.",
      "summaryeli15": "Good morning,\n\nI would like to explain the concept of a proposed extension to BOLT-11 in detail, keeping in mind that you are 15 years old. BOLT-11 is a set of rules and specifications for creating Lightning Network invoices. The extension involves allowing an invoice to contain two bundled payments, each with its own unique details and amounts.\n\nThe reason for this extension is to address a specific use case where services require a prepayment of a mining fee, which is needed for a non-custodian exchange to take place. Two examples of such services are submarine swaps and JIT (Just-in-Time) channels.\n\nIn submarine swaps, a service provider receives a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage (a secret code). They have to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address) and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. However, there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, so the service providers ask for a prepayment of mining fees to protect themselves.\n\nSome services, like Loop by Lightning Labs, can ask for a prepayment because their software is designed to handle it. This is referred to as a \"no show penalty\" on the Loop website. However, competitors who do not require dedicated client software, such as the Boltz exchange, cannot easily implement this prepayment system. Their website shows an invoice to the user, whose wallet is agnostic about the swap, and it would be impractical to show two invoices to be paid simultaneously. This vulnerability creates a situation where Boltz is susceptible to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where the attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees.\n\nIn the case of JIT channels, where providers want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack, they need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. From a legal perspective, this makes the service provider a custodian, even if they open the channel immediately after receiving the preimage. In Europe, this falls under the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from participating.\n\nTo solve this problem, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The proposed semantics (meaning or behavior) of bundled payments are as follows:\n\n1. The BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages (secret codes) and two amounts: a prepayment and the main payment.\n2. The receiver of the invoice should wait until all the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the prepayment with a MPP (Multi-Path Payments) timeout.\n3. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. It's important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this proposed change does not prevent the service provider from potentially stealing the prepayment, but this is already a risk today. The goal of this proposal is to level the playing field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, to use Loop, you need to use a dedicated client, and competitors without an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack. Additionally, this change would allow ACINQ, a Lightning Network development company, to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. Currently, their pay-to-open service may fall under the scope of European MICA regulation, which they should consider a serious issue.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that this proposed change should be implemented in BOLT-11, the existing specification, rather than introducing new specifications like BOLT-12 or onion messages. The reasoning behind this is to avoid adding unnecessary complexity by introducing new message exchanges. The goal is to achieve the desired outcome in a non-interactive way.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you grasp the concept. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.",

      "summary": "In Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a transaction state that determines whether the transaction can be spent and affects the user's balance. The transaction states were previously discussed in review club #27145. \n\nBefore this PR, wallet transactions were considered conflicted only when the conflicting transaction was mined into a block. If a transaction was only conflicting with a mempool transaction, it was considered TxStateInactive, which could confuse users as their funds would temporarily appear to disappear.\n\nThis PR addresses this issue by treating transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. It introduces another transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted and keeps track of the conflicting transactions in a map called MempoolConflicts, which maps wallet transactions' hashes to sets of their mempool conflicts' hashes.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, the reviewer is asked whether they have reviewed it and the possible responses are Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK. The question about the review approach refers to how the reviewer approached their review, for example, whether they focused on the concept, the implementation approach, or testing.\n\nThis PR is fixing a bug. The bug is that transactions with conflicts in the mempool were not treated as conflicted, resulting in temporary confusion for users.\n\nThe trade-off of considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted instead of inactive is that it provides a more consistent user experience. By treating mempool conflicts as conflicts, users don't see their funds appearing to disappear momentarily.\n\nThe first commit is necessary for this PR. It does not change any existing behavior but sets the groundwork for the subsequent commit.\n\nThe MempoolConflicts map is added to keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool. The wallet cannot just check for conflicts in the mapTxSpends because it only contains information about transactions already in the wallet, not the mempool.\n\nThe benefit of adding another transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of just using TxStateConflicted is to differentiate between conflicts with mined transactions and conflicts with mempool transactions.\n\nWith this PR, a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. The changes made in this PR allow the user to abandon transactions in the mempool even if they are conflicting.\n\nAfter a wallet is reloaded, a previously mempool-conflicted transaction will retain its TxStateMempoolConflicted state.\n\nThe tests added to wallet_conflicts.py may fail on the master branch, but it is not specified whether they fail or not.\n\nAlthough this PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made still affect the balance calculation of the wallet. By treating mempool conflicts as conflicts, the wallet takes them into account when calculating the balance.\n\nTxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not treated the same in memory. They have different transaction states and are handled differently by the wallet.\n\nThere is no mention of additional test cases the reviewer would like to see implemented.\n\nThe wallet_abandonconflict.py script needs to be modified in the second commit because it needs to handle the new transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) and the changes made by this PR.",

The PR proposes changes to the handling of conflicted transactions in the mempool.\n3. Currently, on the master branch (the main development branch), wallet transactions are only considered conflicted when the conflicting transaction is confirmed in a block. If a transaction is only conflicted by a mempool transaction, it is considered inactive, which can confuse users as the funds may appear to briefly disappear.\n4. The PR aims to treat transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well. This is done by introducing a new transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted. Additionally, the PR introduces a data structure called MempoolConflicts, which is a map that keeps track of wallet transaction hashes and their corresponding mempool conflicts' transaction hashes.\n5. The reviewer is asked about their evaluation of the PR (whether they conceptually agree, agree with the approach taken, or have tested the proposed changes and agree with them).\n6. The PR is either fixing a bug or adding a new feature. The bug being addressed is the confusion caused by mempool-conflicted transactions being considered inactive, as they should correctly be labeled as conflicted.\n7. The trade-off of considering mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted instead of inactive is that it provides users with more accurate information about their funds. However, it also means that funds might appear to be briefly \"unavailable\" until the conflicts are resolved.\n8. The first commit in the PR is necessary as it introduces the new transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) and modifies the handling of conflicted transactions. It changes the existing behavior by treating mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted instead of inactive.\n9. The point of adding the MempoolConflicts map is to keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool. This allows for better identification and handling of conflicts.\n10. The benefit of adding a separate transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of using TxStateConflicted is to differentiate between conflicts that arise from the mempool and conflicts that arise from confirmed transactions in a block.\n11. With this PR, a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. The changes made in the PR enable users to have more control over their transactions.\n12. After a wallet is reloaded, the transaction state of a previously mempool-conflicted transaction would still be TxStateMempoolConflicted. This ensures that the transaction remains identified as conflicted until the conflicts are resolved.\n13. The tests added in wallet_conflicts.py might fail on the master branch. The question asks whether these tests fail for the reviewer as well.\n14. The changes made in this PR do not directly modify the balance calculation code of the wallet. However, by correctly identifying and handling mempool-conflicted transactions, it ensures that the balance calculation is more accurate.\n15. TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are treated differently in memory. They are given separate transaction states to distinguish between conflicts arising from confirmed transactions and conflicts arising from the mempool.\n16. The question asks if there are any additional test cases the reviewer would like to see implemented to ensure the changes in the PR are robust.\n17. The wallet_abandonconflict.py script needs to be modified in the second commit because the changes introduced in the PR allow users to abandon transactions with mempool conflicts, and this script likely handles that functionality.",

The request asks the reviewer to at least review the notes for the previous review club meeting.\n\nThe -dbcache configuration option is used to determine the amount of memory used for the coins cache and other database-related memory usage. By default, it is set to 450 MiB. The function CalculateCacheSizes() is responsible for calculating the sizes.\n\nUsing less memory than allowed can decrease the cache hit ratio, which means that a lower fraction of lookups will find the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) in the cache. On the other hand, using more memory than specified could lead to crashes on memory-restricted systems.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to have an accurate accounting of the memory used by the cache. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be relatively close.\n\nWhen a program requests a certain number of bytes of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, the library internally allocates slightly more memory for the memory allocator's metadata or overhead. In other words, logical memory is not the same as physical memory.\n\nThe memory allocator metadata is a complex concept that depends on various factors like the machine architecture and memory model.\n\nTo accurately size the cache, it is important to consider the physical memory usage, which includes accounting for this additional allocation metadata. However, there is no library function available that directly maps logical memory size to physical size.\n\nTo address this issue, Bitcoin Core provides a function called MallocUsage(). This function approximates the conversion from logical memory size to physical size. It takes the allocation size as an argument and returns the corresponding physical size.\n\nThe source file memusage.h includes multiple versions of the function DynamicUsage(). These versions are overloaded for different data types used in the system. All the versions of DynamicUsage() make use of MallocUsage().\n\nThe PR #25325 added a new version of DynamicUsage() for the pool memory resource. This allows for the computation of the overall coins cache size, helping to stay within the configured cache size.\n\nThe specific DynamicUsage() overload for the pool memory resource is only called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().\n\nThe question asks if the review has been performed and, if so, what approach was taken. The options given are Concept ACK (acknowledge the overall idea), approach ACK (acknowledge the approach taken), tested ACK (acknowledge that testing has been conducted), or NACK (disapprove the PR). The reviewer is expected to provide their review approach.\n\nIn the master branch (without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has multiple templated arguments. Comparing it to the overload immediately above it (on line 170) would provide insight into why it has this structure.\n\nThe DynamicUsage() overload in the master branch is responsible for calculating memory usage. It works by adding together various values. The question asks the reviewer to identify these values and how they are combined in this PR.\n\nThe question specifically asks why m.bucket_count() is part of the DynamicUsage() calculation and why the memory for the bucket allocation is not already accounted for in the resource \"chunks\".\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location. The reason why m.bucket_count() is no longer needed is also asked. The reviewer should explain the advantage of this change and why referencing m.bucket_count() is not necessary anymore.\n\nFinally, there is an extra credit question asking about cachedCoinsUsage and why it is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in the CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() function. The reviewer should provide an explanation for this additional component and its purpose.",

This PR is a follow-up to PR 25325, which we reviewed on March 8 of this year. It is recommended to review at least the notes for that review club.\n\nThe \"-dbcache\" configuration option in Bitcoin Core determines the amount of memory used for the cache of coins (unspent transaction outputs) and other database-related uses of memory. By default, it is set to 450 MiB. One of the important factors to consider when configuring this option is the memory hit ratio of the coins cache. This ratio represents the fraction of lookups that successfully find the requested unspent transaction output in the cache. Using less memory than allowed reduces the hit ratio, while using more memory poses a risk of crashing the bitcoind process on systems with memory restrictions.\n\nTo ensure the cache operates optimally, it is crucial to have an accurate assessment of the memory used by the cache. Although it doesn't need to be perfect, it should be reasonably close. However, there is a distinction between logical memory and physical memory. When a program requests a certain amount of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, the library allocates slightly more memory for the allocator's metadata or overhead. In other words, the logical memory requested by the program is not the same as the actual physical memory used.\n\nThe memory allocation metadata can be somewhat complex and depends on various factors like the machine architecture and memory model. Since there is no built-in library function that directly maps logical memory size to physical size, Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage() to provide an approximation of this conversion. MallocUsage() takes an allocation size as its argument and returns the corresponding physical memory size.\n\nIn the source file memusage.h, there are multiple overloads of the function DynamicUsage(). These overloads are used for different data types that might be allocated within the system, and they all utilize MallocUsage(). One of the overloads added by PR #25325 is specifically for the pool memory resource and is responsible for calculating the overall size of the coins cache. This allows the implementation to stay within the configured cache size.\n\nIn the master branch (without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has many templated arguments to handle various data types. By comparing it to the overload immediately above it on line 170, one can infer that the templated arguments serve to handle different resource types and calculate their memory usage accordingly.\n\nOn the master branch, this DynamicUsage() overload worked by summing the memory used by the bucket's pool resource, the bucket map, and the dynamic memory usage of the bucket's elements.\n\nIn this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location. As a result, the reference to m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. This change brings the advantage of simplifying the calculation and reducing redundancy. The memory for the bucket allocation is already accounted for in the resource \"chunks,\" so explicitly referencing m.bucket_count() is unnecessary.\n\nExtra credit: cachedCoinsUsage is a variable that represents the memory usage of the cache of coins. It holds the dynamic memory usage of the cacheCoins() function. CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() adds cachedCoinsUsage to the overall memory usage reported by memusage::DynamicUsage(). This inclusion ensures that the memory usage of the coins cache is accurately accounted for in the dynamic memory usage calculation.",

Alongside mapRelay, there is another data structure called g_relay_expiration, which is a sorted list of expiration times for the entries in mapRelay. Each entry in mapRelay and g_relay_expiration remains there for 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer requests a transaction by sending a getdata message, and the transaction is no longer present in the mempool, it can be served from mapRelay.\n\nmapRelay has been present for a long time, even in the first github commit. However, its significance has diminished over time. Bitcoin Core, for instance, now tries to fetch transactions directly from the mempool before turning to mapRelay. Although there were reasons for keeping mapRelay in the codebase until now, most of these reasons have become obsolete due to other improvements.\n\nThis PR removes mapRelay and replaces it with m_most_recent_block_txs, which is a new data structure used to keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block.\n\nRegarding the review of the PR, it is not mentioned whether the reviewer has actively reviewed it or in what capacity. The choices provided for acknowledgement are Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK.\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because it is a data structure that accumulates transactions over time and removes them after 15 minutes. As mentioned in the comment, determining the exact memory usage of mapRelay would require profiling the code during an actual running instance of the program.\n\nThe introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of unnecessary memory usage caused by keeping all relayed transactions in mapRelay. By only keeping track of transactions from the most recent block, the memory requirements can be reduced significantly. It is necessary to introduce m_most_recent_block_txs as it provides a more efficient and targeted solution compared to simply removing mapRelay without any replacement.\n\nIn terms of memory requirements, m_most_recent_block_txs should have lower memory requirements compared to mapRelay. This is because m_most_recent_block_txs only keeps track of the transactions from the most recent block, whereas mapRelay keeps track of all relayed transactions for 15 minutes.\n\nAs a result of this change, there could be scenarios where transactions become available for a shorter duration than before. This is because mapRelay keeps transactions for 15 minutes, whereas m_most_recent_block_txs only contains transactions from the most recent block. If a transaction was relayed more than 15 minutes ago, it would not be present in m_most_recent_block_txs and therefore would not be available for as long as it was in mapRelay.\n\nPossible downsides of removing mapRelay could include the loss of some redundancy in transaction availability. Although Bitcoin Core already tries to fetch transactions directly from the mempool, mapRelay acted as a backup source. By removing mapRelay, there is a chance that some transactions that were previously available as backups may no longer be retrievable if they are not in the mempool. Additionally, if there are any other parts of the codebase that rely on mapRelay, removing it could potentially break or require changes to those parts.",

It is accompanied by \"g_relay_expiration,\" which is a sorted list of expiration times for the mapRelay entries. The entries stay in mapRelay and g_relay_expiration for a duration of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen a peer requests a transaction by sending a \"getdata\" message, but that transaction is no longer in the mempool (where pending transactions are stored), it can be served from the mapRelay instead.\n\nIt is worth noting that mapRelay has been present in the codebase for a long time, even from the first GitHub commit. While it was essential initially, its functionality has been reduced over time. For example, Bitcoin Core now attempts to fetch transactions directly from the mempool. Various reasons prevented the removal of mapRelay earlier, but most of these reasons have become obsolete due to other improvements in the codebase.\n\nThis PR intends to remove mapRelay and introduce a new data structure called \"m_most_recent_block_txs\" that will keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block.\n\nThe question \"Did you review the PR?\" is a query about whether the person being asked has reviewed the pull request (PR) in question. The possible responses are as follows:\n1. Concept ACK: The person agrees with the overall concept and purpose of the PR.\n2. Approach ACK: The person approves of the approach taken in the PR.\n3. Tested ACK: The person acknowledges that the proposed changes have been tested and are functional.\n4. NACK: The person does not approve of the PR.\n\nThe memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine mainly because the amount of memory it occupies depends on the number of transactions relayed, the size of each transaction, and the time since the transaction was relayed. In the comment mentioned, it is highlighted that the usage of mapRelay can vary widely and may not be predictable or straightforward to estimate accurately.\n\nThe introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of tracking and serving only the transactions from the most recent block. This data structure ensures that the most recent transactions are readily available for retrieval if requested by a peer. In this case, it is necessary to introduce m_most_recent_block_txs as a replacement for mapRelay.\n\nThe memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs compared to mapRelay would likely be lower. Since m_most_recent_block_txs only keeps track of the transactions from the most recent block, it would typically contain fewer entries compared to mapRelay, which used to store all the relayed transactions. Hence, the memory footprint of m_most_recent_block_txs should be smaller.\n\nAs a result of this change, there might be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time compared to before. This would largely depend on how quickly new blocks are mined, as m_most_recent_block_txs only includes transactions from the most recent block. If blocks are mined frequently, the window of availability for each transaction might be shorter. Conversely, if blocks are mined less frequently, transactions may remain available for longer.\n\nSome possible downsides of removing mapRelay could include:\n1. Increased reliance on mempool: Since mapRelay was used to serve transactions that are no longer in the mempool, removing it may place more load on the mempool infrastructure.\n2. Increased latency: Without mapRelay, transactions that are not in the mempool would need to be fetched from other sources, potentially resulting in increased retrieval time and network latency.\n3. Reduced redundancy: mapRelay provided redundancy by keeping a copy of relayed transactions, which could be valuable in certain situations. Removing it would eliminate this redundancy.",

      "summary": "The given passage provides information about a pull request (PR) made in the libbitcoinkernel project, which aims to separate Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from other non-consensus components in the codebase. The details of this PR are discussed below:\n\n1. The PR branch HEAD: The PR branch HEAD refers to the specific commit (a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5) that was the latest at the time of the review club meeting. This commit serves as a reference point for the changes made in the PR.\n\n2. Purpose of the libbitcoinkernel project: The libbitcoinkernel project focuses on decoupling Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from non-consensus modules like indices in the codebase. This separation allows for easier maintenance, testing, and development of both parts independently.\n\n3. Previously covered PRs: The passage mentions three PRs (#25527, #24410, and #20158) related to the libbitcoinkernel project, which have been previously reviewed or discussed.\n\n4. Introduction of kernel::Notifications interface: PR #27636 introduces the kernel::Notifications interface, which serves as a means for node implementations (e.g., KernelNotifications) to trigger specific behaviors based on events. This PR aims to extend this interface to handle events related to the consensus engine requiring a shutdown, both expected and unexpected.\n\n5. New notification methods: PR #27711 adds two new notification methods, kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. These methods allow the node to implement the necessary actions when a shutdown is initiated or a fatal error occurs.\n\n6. Moving shutdown files and uiInterface: Additionally, this PR includes moving the shutdown files and removing the remaining usages of the uiInterface from the kernel code. This process was initially started in PR #27636.\n\nNow, let's address the specific questions raised in the passage:\n\n- Review of the PR: The passage asks whether the PR has been reviewed and what approach was taken in the review. The provided options for review feedback are Concept ACK (conceptually acceptable), approach ACK (implementation approach acceptable), tested ACK (thoroughly tested and acceptable), or NACK (not acceptable). The passage does not provide the reviewer's response.\n\n- startShutdown in two locations: The question asks why the startShutdown method is present in both kernel/notifications_interface.h and node/kernel_notifications.h. Without further context, it is unclear why this duplication exists and whether it is intentional or an oversight. A thorough examination of both header files and their usage may shed light on the reasons behind this duplication.\n\n- Role of fRequestShutdown: The passage mentions fRequestShutdown but does not provide sufficient context to determine its exact role in terminating long-running kernel functions. Additional details or analysis would be required to clarify this aspect.\n\n- Contribution of the notification interface: The notification interface, as introduced by PR #27636 and extended in PR #27711, aids in decoupling non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel. By using a notification interface, the consensus engine can trigger specific behaviors without directly relying on or being entangled with the non-consensus code. This helps to make the codebase modular and promotes easier maintenance and development.\n\n- Flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications: The passage requests an explanation of the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications in the new setup. To provide a detailed description of this flow, more information about the code implementation and its interactions would be necessary. Understanding the producers and consumers of these notifications and their handling process is crucial to explaining their flow accurately.\n\n- Race conditions and synchronization issues: The passage inquires about potential race conditions or synchronization issues that may arise with the use of the notification interface depicted in this context. Without a more detailed examination of the code and its implementation, it is challenging to identify potential issues accurately. However, race conditions or synchronization problems can occur when multiple threads access shared resources or modify shared state concurrently. Analyzing the relevant code sections and their interactions can help determine if there are any risks in this regard.\n\n- KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested reference: The question asks why KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested is a reference value. The passage does not provide a definitive answer to this question, and further analysis of the code would be necessary to understand the context and reasoning behind this design choice. Considering that the decision was made to use a reference, it might have been to enable direct modification of the shutdown status by the consuming code without the need for indirection through a pointer or copy.\n\n- Alternative approaches for triggering a shutdown: The passage seeks ideas for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown instead of using KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested as a reference. Unfortunately, the passage does not provide any suggestions or possible alternatives, so it remains open to exploration and discussion based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.",

      "summary": "This week's newsletter starts by summarizing a discussion about extending BOLT11 invoices to request two separate payments. Thomas Voegtlin suggested that BOLT11 invoices be extended to allow the receiver to request two payments from a spender, with each payment having a separate secret and amount. This could be useful for submarine swaps and JIT channels. Voegtlin explains that in the current setup, if the user doesn't disclose their secret, the service provider won't receive any compensation and will incur on-chain costs for no gain. He believes that existing JIT channel service providers avoid this problem by requiring the user to disclose their secret before the funding transaction is secure. However, he argues that this approach may create legal problems and prevent non-custodial wallets from offering a similar service. Voegtlin suggests that by allowing a BOLT11 invoice to contain two separate commitments to secrets, each for a different amount, it would be possible to use one secret and amount for an upfront fee to pay the on-chain transaction costs, and the other secret and amount for the actual submarine swap or JIT channel funding.\n\nThe proposal received several comments. Matt Corallo replied that it hasn't been possible to get all Lightning Network (LN) implementations to update their BOLT11 support to support invoices that don't contain an amount, so he doesn't think adding an additional field is a practical approach at this time. Another comment suggests adding support to offers instead. However, Voegtlin disagrees and thinks adding support is practical. The discussion was ongoing at the time of writing.\n\nThe newsletter also includes a limited weekly series about mempool policy, providing insights into transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explains the differences in policy between nodes and how matching mempools help to relay transactions smoothly and improve fee estimation and compact block relay.\n\nIn the section highlighting updates to Bitcoin wallets and services, the newsletter mentions the following:\n\n- Greenlight, a non-custodial CLN node service provider, has open-sourced a repository of client libraries and language bindings, as well as a testing framework guide.\n- Tapsim is a script execution debugging and visualization tool for tapscript using btcd.\n- Bitcoin Keeper 1.0.4 has been announced, which is a mobile wallet supporting multisig, hardware signers, BIP85, and coinjoin support using the Whirlpool protocol.\n- EttaWallet, a new Lightning wallet, has been announced with Lightning features enabled by LDK (Lightning Development Kit) and a strong usability focus inspired by the daily spending wallet reference design from the Bitcoin Design Community.\n- BTC Warp, a light client sync proof-of-concept using zkSNARKs to prove and verify a chain of Bitcoin block headers, has been introduced.\n- lnprototest v0.0.4 has been released, which is a test suite for LN including test helpers written in Python3.\n\nThe newsletter also mentions new releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects, including Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, BDK, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition.

      "summary": "In this week's newsletter, several topics are discussed in detail. \n\nFirstly, Greg Sanders proposes a solution for preventing the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Coinjoin transactions involve multiple participants combining their bitcoins into a single transaction to enhance privacy. The problem with pinning arises when one participant uses their input to the transaction to create a conflicting transaction, thereby preventing the coinjoin transaction from being confirmed. Sanders suggests that the proposed v3 transaction relay rules could mitigate this issue. He proposes that each participant initially spends their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent either by a signature from all participants or by the participant alone after a certain timelock expires. This means that until the timelock expires, participants must obtain co-signature from other parties or the coordinator to create conflicting transactions. This reduces the likelihood of such conflicts unless it is in the best interests of all participants. However, this solution relies on the assumption that Bitcoin's consensus rules will be changed (e.g. OP_ZKP_VERIFY will be added), and anyone who benefits from this solution is making a bet on that change.\n\nAnother topic discussed is a limited weekly series about mempool policy. This series explores transaction relay, mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection. It explains why Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than allowed by consensus and how wallets can effectively use that policy. The previous post in this series discussed protecting node resources, which may vary for each node. It also made the case for converging on one policy to ensure network-wide scalability, upgradeability, and accessibility of maintaining a full node. The post highlights the importance of limiting blockchain growth to keep it affordable to run a node, and how a minimum cost (minRelayTxFee of 1 sat/vbyte) discourages excessive blockchain growth.\n\nThe newsletter also includes a section on popular questions and answers from the Bitcoin Stack Exchange. Some of the top-voted questions and answers are highlighted, covering topics such as why Bitcoin nodes accept blocks with excluded transactions, the impact of soft forks on the existing ruleset, the default Lightning Network channel limit, transaction selection by Bitcoin Core, and the definition of amounts per part in Lightning multipart payments (MPP) protocol.\n\nAdditionally, the newsletter provides updates on new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects. This includes notable changes in Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, Eclair, LDK, LND, libsecp256k1, Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, BDK, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Lightning BOLTs, and Bitcoin Inquisition. The changes range from the addition of new features to improvements in performance and security.\n\nFinally, the newsletter mentions a section on helping Bitcoin-based businesses integrate scaling technology, although specific details about this topic are not provided.",
      "summaryeli15": "This week's newsletter focuses on several topics related to Bitcoin. Here's a breakdown of each section:\n\n1. Preventing coinjoin pinning with v3 transaction relay: The first topic discusses a proposal by Greg Sanders to prevent the pinning of coinjoin transactions. Coinjoin is a technique where multiple participants combine their BTC transactions to make it difficult for external observers to determine the source or destination of funds. The issue with coinjoin is that one of the participants can create a conflicting transaction that prevents the coinjoin transaction from confirming. Sanders suggests using v3 transaction relay rules to address this problem by having each participant initially spend their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by either a signature from all participants or by just the participant after a timelock expires.

Payment channel networks are a type of off-chain scaling solution for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, aiming to improve scalability and speed by conducting transactions off the blockchain.\n\nRebalancing refers to the process of maintaining balanced funds in the payment channels to ensure efficient and uninterrupted operation. It involves transferring funds between channels to ensure that each channel has sufficient liquidity for transactions.\n\nThe paper introduces the Musketeer protocol, which aims to address the challenges and limitations of existing rebalancing approaches in payment channel networks.

This is crucial in ensuring the protocol's success and widespread adoption.\n\nThe authors likely provide detailed explanations, algorithms, mathematical models, and experimental results in the paper to support their proposed solution.

The authors of the paper are Zeta Avarikioti, Stefan Schmid, and Samarth Tiwari. \n\nPayment channel networks are a type of technology that allows for faster and cheaper transactions on blockchain-based platforms, such as cryptocurrencies. These networks operate by opening up payment channels between users, which allows them to conduct multiple transactions without having to record each transaction on the blockchain. This helps to reduce transaction fees and increase scalability.\n\nHowever, one challenge that arises in payment channel networks is the issue of balancing. Balancing refers to the ability of users to maintain an equal amount of funds on both ends of the payment channel. This is important because if one user has more funds on their end, it limits their ability to conduct transactions with other users. The paper is addressing this challenge and proposing a solution called \"Musketeer.\"\n\nThe goal of Musketeer is to provide a mechanism for incentivizing users to rebalance their payment channels. Rebalancing involves moving funds from one end of the channel to the other in order to maintain balance. The authors of the paper recognize that because users have an incentive to prioritize their own interests, they may not be motivated to rebalance their channels, which can lead to imbalances and hinder the network's efficiency.\n\nMusketeer aims to solve this problem by introducing incentives for users to rebalance their channels. The paper suggests a mechanism that rewards users for rebalancing and penalizes them for not doing so. This encourages users to maintain balanced channels, as it is in their best interest to do so.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in the paper uses various techniques, such as economic incentives and game theory, to ensure that users are motivated to rebalance their channels. It takes into account factors such as transaction fees, network congestion, and user preferences when determining the appropriate incentives and penalties.\n\nBy introducing a system of incentives and penalties, Musketeer aims to create a more efficient and balanced payment channel network. This would improve the overall user experience, increase the network's scalability, and reduce transaction costs.\n\nOverall, this research paper presents a solution to the challenges of maintaining balance in payment channel networks. It proposes the Musketeer mechanism, which uses incentives and penalties to motivate users to rebalance their channels. This solution has the potential to enhance the efficiency and scalability of payment channel networks, ultimately benefiting users of blockchain-based platforms.",

The paper was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in the year 2023 and is available at the URL: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/977.\n\nTimed commitments refer to a cryptographic primitive that allows parties to commit to a value for a certain period of time. Commitments in cryptography are a way for someone to publicly declare a value or message without revealing its content. This can be useful in various scenarios such as secure auctions, anonymous voting, or secure multiparty computation.\n\nThe paper begins by introducing the concept of timed commitments and explaining their importance in different cryptographic protocols and applications. It then proceeds to discuss the existing literature on timed commitments, highlighting the limitations and challenges associated with current approaches.\n\nThe authors then propose a new construction for timed commitments, building upon previous research in this area. They present a detailed analysis of their construction, explaining the underlying techniques, assumptions, and security properties. The focus is on achieving both efficiency and security in the timed commitment scheme.\n\nTo evaluate the practicality and performance of their construction, the authors provide experimental results and compare them with existing approaches. They discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their scheme, as well as potential areas for further improvement or future research.\n\nThroughout the paper, the authors provide mathematical formulations, proofs, and technical discussions to support their claims and justify the design choices made in their construction. They also discuss potential attack vectors and countermeasures to ensure the security of the proposed scheme.\n\nThe paper concludes by summarizing the contributions made and discussing the potential impact of the proposed construction on the field of timed commitments. It also highlights open research questions and possible directions for future work.\n\nOverall, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of timed commitments, presenting a novel construction and analyzing its properties in detail.

The paper was published in the Cryptology ePrint Archive in the year 2023, and it can be accessed online through the provided URL.\n\nThe topic of this research paper is about Bitcoin and a specific aspect of its security called ECDSA nonces. To understand what this means, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralized network called the blockchain. It allows people to send and receive money without the need for a central authority like a bank.\n\n2. ECDSA: ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. It is a cryptographic algorithm used by Bitcoin (and many other systems) to create digital signatures. Digital signatures are like electronic fingerprints that ensure messages or transactions are authentic and tamper-proof.\n\n3. Nonce: In cryptography, a nonce is a number that is used only once. In the context of Bitcoin's ECDSA algorithm, a nonce is a random number that is generated for each signature. This nonce is combined with the private key of the signer to produce a unique signature every time.\n\n4. The curious case of the half-half Bitcoin ECDSA nonces: The paper explores a peculiar behavior observed in the generation of nonces in Bitcoin's ECDSA algorithm. In theory, the nonces should be randomly generated for each signature. However, the researchers discovered that some nonces had a pattern where the most significant half of the bits (binary digits) were the same for multiple signatures.\n\nThis pattern is concerning because nonces should be completely unpredictable. If a pattern exists, it opens up possibilities for attackers to exploit this weakness and potentially break the cryptographic security of signatures.\n\nTo investigate this pattern, the authors performed extensive analysis on a large dataset of Bitcoin transactions. They examined the occurrences of these half-half nonces and sought to understand the reasons behind their existence. The paper discusses various hypotheses and provides empirical evidence to support their findings.\n\nBy shedding light on this curious case, the research aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and reliability of Bitcoin's ECDSA algorithm. This type of analysis helps identify vulnerabilities and allows for the development of countermeasures to enhance the overall security of the Bitcoin system.",

      "summary": "On April 12th, there was an attempted attack on Atlantis Loans, a lending protocol on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), but it failed to pass. The developers had abandoned the project in early April, informing the users through a Medium post that they could no longer afford to maintain the platform. They stated that discontinuing their services was in the best interest of the users and to protect their funds. However, the protocol remained live, and the user interface (UI) was even paid up in advance for two years. The post mentioned that any changes or turning off of the platform would have to be done through the governance system.\n\nRecently, the attacker was successful in pushing and voting through a governance proposal that granted them control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts. The attacker then upgraded the contracts with their own malicious contracts, allowing them to transfer tokens from any address that had active approvals to Atlantis contracts. The attacker's address is 0xEADe071FF23bceF312deC938eCE29f7da62CF45b. It is worth noting that the attacker was initially funded by Binance on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGovernance attacks can have varying scopes and effects. In the past, we have seen similar attacks on other projects. For example, Tornado Cash's governance system was hijacked by an attacker who sneaked code into a supposedly safe proposal. Beanstalk lost $181 million due to a flash loan-enabled governance attack that exploited a lack of execution delay on the proposal. Swerve, a Curve-clone project, was also targeted through governance, but the attack was unsuccessful.\n\nThis recent case serves as a reminder to users to revoke old token approvals and to carefully monitor governance processes, even on defunct projects. It highlights the importance of staying vigilant and protecting one's funds. The author of the article also mentions other recent incidents of rug pulls (where projects steal funds from users) and attacks on different DeFi platforms on the BSC.\n\nOverall, the Atlantis Loans attack demonstrates the ongoing challenges and risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and the need for users to exercise caution and stay informed.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! So, let's break down what happened in this situation.\n\nThere is a lending protocol called Atlantis Loans that was running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). However, the developers of the protocol abandoned it in early April and announced to the users through a Medium post that they could no longer afford to maintain the platform. They believed that discontinuing their services was in the best interest of the users and the protection of their funds.\n\nEven though the developers left, the protocol remained live and the user interface (UI) was paid up in advance for two years. The only way to make changes or turn things off was through the governance system. However, little attention was paid to a proposal published on June 7th, as the project had already been abandoned.\n\nOn the 12th of April, an attack was attempted on Atlantis Loans, but it failed to pass. With the project abandoned, not much attention was given to recent proposals. This gave an opportunity to an attacker who pushed and voted through a governance proposal that granted them control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts. They then upgraded the contracts with their own malicious code, which allowed them to transfer tokens from any address that still had active approvals to the Atlantis contracts.\n\nIf you want more details on how the proposal was executed, you can refer to Numen Cyber's thread.\n\nThe attacker's address is provided as 0xEADe071FF23bceF312deC938eCE29f7da62CF45b, and it is mentioned that they were initially funded by Binance on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis type of attack, known as a governance attack, can have different scopes and effects. In the past, Tornado Cash and Beanstalk also experienced governance attacks, which resulted in significant financial losses. Another project, Swerve, was also targeted, but the attack was not successful.\n\nThis recent incident is a reminder that users should revoke old token approvals and also highlights the importance of carefully monitoring governance processes, even on projects that are no longer active.\n\nIn addition to the Atlantis Loans attack, there were also other incidents mentioned in the text. DeFiLabs lost $1.6M through a backdoor function in their staking contract, and Midas lost $600k due to a known vulnerability. Level Finance also suffered a loss of $1.1M in referral rewards.\n\nThese incidents show that vulnerabilities can quickly spread through the ecosystem, and it emphasizes the need for developers and users to learn from these experiences and improve the security of their projects.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you understand what happened in this situation!",

      "summary": "The researchers came up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs due to their observation that the intensity/color of power LEDs can be used to detect the beginning and end of cryptographic operations. They noticed that the power consumption of a device correlates with the intensity/brightness of its power LED, as the LED is directly connected to the power line of the electrical circuit without effective means of decoupling the correlation with power consumption.\n\nThis correlation between power consumption and power LED intensity/brightness provided an opportunity for attackers to exploit vulnerable cryptographic algorithms that are susceptible to side-channel attacks. By capturing video footage of the power LED using commercial video cameras, the researchers were able to visually analyze the changes in intensity/color and deduce information about the cryptographic operations being performed.\n\nTo differentiate their video-based cryptanalysis from prior methods, the researchers highlight that it combines vulnerable cryptographic algorithms with vulnerable power LEDs. This combination allows for the recovery of secret keys in a weaker threat model compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryptanalysis methods. This is because video-based cryptanalysis utilizes commonly used sensors (video cameras) instead of specialized professional sensors, and it does not require compromising the target device with malware.\n\nIt's important to note that the vulnerabilities exploited in video-based cryptanalysis are not inherent to power LEDs themselves. The vulnerabilities originate from the cryptographic libraries used by the devices. However, power LEDs provide the necessary visual infrastructure for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\nTo prevent the demonstrated attacks, the researchers recommend using the most updated cryptographic libraries available. However, even with up-to-date libraries, there may still be potential risks due to the presence of unknown vulnerabilities (0-day vulnerabilities) in the code. The researchers highlight that previously known vulnerable cryptographic libraries were once considered the most updated, emphasizing the evolving nature of security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks specifically because these attacks were recently discovered and serve as reminders that even recent cryptographic libraries may still be vulnerable.\n\nThe video-based cryptanalysis attacks were successfully demonstrated on certain devices. At least six smartcard readers manufactured by five different manufacturers were found to be vulnerable to a direct attack. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S8 was found to be vulnerable to an indirect attack.\n\nAttackers need to obtain video footage filled with the LED of the target device because cryptanalysis requires a high sampling rate. By capturing video footage that completely fills the frame with the LED, attackers can exploit the rolling shutter effect to increase the number of measurements of the LED's color/intensity. Normally, the frame rate of video cameras is around 60 frames per second (FPS), which would result in 60 measurements per second. However, with the rolling shutter technique, the researchers were able to achieve a sampling rate of 60,000 measurements per second using the iPhone 13 Pro Max. This increased sampling rate is necessary to successfully attack functional IoT devices such as smartphones, smartcards, and TV streamers.\n\nIf a device does not have a power LED, it is not directly susceptible to attacks targeting the LED itself. However, attackers may still be able to recover the device's secret key indirectly by capturing video footage of the power LED of a connected peripheral device.\n\nOverall, the idea of conducting cryptanalysis using power LEDs arose from the correlation between power consumption and the intensity/brightness of power LEDs. By using video footage of these LEDs, vulnerable cryptographic algorithms can be exploited, and secret keys can be recovered. Up-to-date cryptographic libraries can mitigate the risk, but the presence of undiscovered vulnerabilities may still pose potential threats.",
      "summaryeli15": "A: Our research team came up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs because we noticed that the intensity or brightness of a device's power LED can indicate the device's power consumption. In many electrical circuits, the power LED is directly connected to the power line without any effective measures to decouple it from the power consumption. This means that the power LED can provide information about the device's CPU operations, which are closely related to cryptographic operations. By analyzing the intensity or color changes of the power LED, we can detect the beginning and end of these cryptographic operations.\n\nQ: How does video-based cryptanalysis differ from previous methods used for cryptanalysis?\n\nA: Video-based cryptanalysis combines two vulnerabilities: vulnerable cryptographic algorithms and vulnerable power LEDs. Cryptographic algorithms that are susceptible to side-channel attacks can be exploited when combined with power LEDs that leak information through their intensity or brightness. What sets video-based cryptanalysis apart from previous methods is that it allows attackers to recover secret keys using commonly available video cameras as sensors, rather than specialized professional sensors like scopes or electromagnetic radiation detectors. This means that attackers can perform these attacks without compromising the target device with malware.\n\nQ: Why is the threat model considered weaker or easier compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryptanalysis methods?\n\nA: The threat model for video-based cryptanalysis is considered weaker or easier compared to SOTA cryptanalysis methods because it doesn't rely on specialized professional sensors or the compromise of the target device with malware. Instead, it leverages commonly available video cameras as sensors to capture video footage of the power LED. This makes the attack more accessible to potential attackers, as video cameras are widely available and don't require advanced technical knowledge or resources.\n\nQ: Is the vulnerability in the power LED itself?\n\nA: No, the vulnerability is not in the power LED itself. The vulnerability lies in the cryptographic libraries used by the devices. However, power LEDs provide the infrastructure needed to visually exploit this vulnerability. By analyzing the intensity or color changes of the power LED, we can infer information about the device's CPU operations and potentially recover secret keys.\n\nQ: What is the best way to prevent the attacks demonstrated in the research?\n\nA: The best way to prevent the demonstrated attacks is to use the most updated cryptographic libraries available. Keeping the cryptographic libraries up to date can help mitigate the vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. It's important to regularly update the software and firmware of devices to ensure they have the latest security patches and improvements.\n\nQ: Why did the researchers choose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks?\n\nA: The researchers chose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks because these attacks were recently discovered (HertzBleed in 2022 and Minerva in 2020) and highlight that even recent cryptographic libraries may still have vulnerabilities. By showcasing these attacks, the researchers aim to raise awareness about the potential vulnerabilities present in cryptographic implementations and the need for ongoing security improvements.\n\nQ: If I use the most updated cryptographic libraries, am I still at risk?\n\nA: It is difficult to say with certainty whether you are completely risk-free even when using the most updated cryptographic libraries. While using updated libraries is essential for maintaining security, there is always the possibility of unknown vulnerabilities, commonly referred to as \"0-day vulnerabilities,\" existing in the code. In the past, even the cryptographic libraries that were considered the most updated ones had vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to stay vigilant, regularly update your software and firmware, and follow best security practices to minimize the risk.\n\nQ: Which devices are vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis?\n\nA: In the research, at least six smartcard readers from five different manufacturers were found to be vulnerable to a direct attack using video-based cryptanalysis. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S8 was susceptible to an indirect attack. The specific devices vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis may vary, but the vulnerability lies in the combination of vulnerable cryptographic algorithms and power LEDs that leak information.\n\nQ: Can other devices be vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis?\n\nA: Yes, other devices may also be vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis. The vulnerability arises from the combination of vulnerable cryptographic algorithms and power LEDs that leak information. While the research specifically identified vulnerable smartcard readers and the Samsung Galaxy S8, it is possible that other devices using similar cryptographic algorithms and power LEDs may also be susceptible to these attacks.\n\nQ: Why do attackers need video footage of the power LED of the target device?\n\nA: Attackers need video footage filled with the LED of the target device because cryptanalysis requires a high sampling rate. By capturing video footage with the power LED filling the frame, attackers can exploit the rolling shutter effect of video cameras. The rolling shutter captures measurements of the LED's color or intensity at an incredibly high frequency, much higher than the normal frames per second (FPS) rate of video recording. This increase in sampling rate, from around 60 measurements per second to potentially 60,000 measurements per second, provides the necessary data for attackers to analyze and potentially recover secret keys from the device.\n\nQ: If a device doesn't have a power LED, is it still at risk?\n\nA: If a device doesn't have an integrated power LED, attackers cannot directly recover secret keys from its power LED because it doesn't exist. However, in an indirect attack, attackers might still be able to recover the secret key from the device by obtaining video footage from a power LED of a connected peripheral. For example, if a device is connected to USB speakers with a power LED, attackers could potentially analyze the video footage of the speakers' power LED to gather information about the device and recover the secret keys.\n\nQ: How did the researchers come up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs?\n\nA: The researchers came up with the idea to conduct cryptanalysis using power LEDs based on their observation of the correlation between the intensity or brightness of a device's power LED and its power consumption. In many electrical circuits, the power LED is connected directly to the power line without any effective decoupling methods. This means that the power LED can provide insights into the device's CPU operations, which are closely related to cryptographic operations. By analyzing the power LED's characteristics, such as its intensity or color changes, the researchers realized they could potentially exploit this visual information to recover secret keys from devices.",

      "summary": "In this detailed explanation, we will be discussing an incident involving Sturdy Finance, an Ethereum-based lending protocol, and its loss of approximately $800,000 to a price manipulation exploit. The protocol offers leverage to yield farmers who deposit staked assets as collateral. \n\nUpon discovering the attack, the Sturdy Finance team issued a statement acknowledging the exploit and taking action. They paused all markets to prevent further risk and assured users that no additional funds were at stake and no immediate action was required from them.\n\nThe attack on Sturdy Finance bears similarities to previous exploits on other platforms such as Midas Capital and dForce Network, as pointed out by Ancilia. The attack utilized a flash loan, targeting SturdyOracle, a component of the protocol. The attacker manipulated the price of the collateral token, known as B-stETH-STABLE.\n\nThe attacker's Ethereum address is 0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b, and the attack contract, which incorporates front-running protection, is located at 0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab. \n\nThe attacker swiftly deposited the stolen funds, amounting to 442 ETH ($800,000), into Tornado Cash for laundering purposes. This process was completed within just 20 minutes of the funds being acquired.\n\nThis particular vulnerability, known as a read-only reentrancy vulnerability, has been exploited in numerous attacks over the past year. In February, a post on Balancer forums highlighted the susceptibility of certain Balancer pools to this attack vector, and the pools targeted in this incident were among those considered vulnerable.\n\nIt is surprising that these pools remained open to attack, despite having undergone three separate audits from Certik, Quantstamp, and Code4rena. Considering the well-known exploit type, this raises discussions about the necessity of oracle-free lending systems, which has become a significant topic of interest. However, it is worth noting that even certain oracle-dependent solutions may also require careful consideration and security measures.\n\nLooking ahead, it is essential for protocols to ensure stronger foundations and security measures to prevent incidents like this from occurring. This incident serves as a reminder of the risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) and the need for constant vigilance in maintaining the integrity of such systems.\n\nIn addition to the Sturdy Finance incident, there have been other recent cases of rug pulls and losses in the DeFi space. DeFiLabs, for instance, exploited a backdoor function in their staking contract to defraud their users of $1.6 million on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This kind of fraudulent activity is not uncommon in the industry and has been likened to a \"shitcoin casino.\" \n\nSimilarly, AlphaPo suffered a loss of $60 million, which didn't attract much attention, as compromised hot wallets and security breaches have become a somewhat common occurrence. Finally, EraLend lost $3.4 million due to the same read-only reentrancy bug that has been a recurring issue in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is worth noting that comments alone do not provide effective protection against reentrancy attacks.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this detailed explanation is presented solely for informational purposes, and the views and content hosted on REKT should not be attributed to any specific entity.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure, I can explain this in more detail!\n\nSturdy Finance is a platform that allows people to borrow money for investing in cryptocurrency. They use the Ethereum blockchain to do this. They offer a feature called leverage, which means that users can borrow more money than they actually have. This can be useful for investors who want to take advantage of opportunities in the market.\n\nUnfortunately, Sturdy Finance recently experienced an attack that resulted in them losing around $800,000. The attack was carried out by exploiting a vulnerability in their system. It is unclear exactly how the attack was carried out, but it involved manipulating the price of a specific cryptocurrency called B-stETH-STABLE.\n\nThe attacker used a technique called flash loans, which are a type of loan that is borrowed and repaid within the same transaction. By using a flash loan, the attacker was able to manipulate the price of B-stETH-STABLE and make a profit of 442 ETH, which is equivalent to around $800,000. They then deposited this profit into another service called Tornado Cash, which allows for anonymous transactions.\n\nThis type of vulnerability has been seen in other attacks over the past year. In fact, there have been similar attacks on other platforms like Midas Capital and dForce Network. It is surprising that Sturdy Finance was vulnerable to this type of attack, considering they had undergone three separate security audits. These audits are conducted by external companies to identify any vulnerabilities in the platform.\n\nAfter the attack, the Sturdy Finance team paused all trading on their platform to prevent any further losses. They assured users that no additional funds were at risk and that no action was required on the part of the users. However, this attack has raised concerns about the need for more secure systems in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nOther platforms have also experienced similar attacks. DeFiLabs recently lost $1.6 million through a vulnerability in their system. AlphaPo lost $60 million in a separate incident. These attacks highlight the need for stronger security measures to protect users' funds.\n\nIn conclusion, Sturdy Finance lost a significant amount of money due to a price manipulation exploit. The attacker used a flash loan to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency and make a profit. This vulnerability has been seen in other attacks, and it raises concerns about the security of decentralized finance platforms.",

When this flag is used, the software makes a connection to a specific peer, gathers network addresses from that peer, and then disconnects. This is useful if the user wants to prioritize addresses from a specific node over fixed seeds.\n\nHowever, there is an issue when disabling DNS seeds and specifying the \"-seednode\" flag. The software immediately removes the entry from the list of addresses to fetch (m_addr_fetches) before the seednode has a chance to provide addresses. Once m_addr_fetches is empty, the software adds fixed seeds, which creates a \"race\" between the fixed seeds and seednodes filling up the address manager (AddrMan).\n\nTo address this issue, the code proposal suggests checking for any provided \"-seednode\" argument instead of using the size of m_addr_fetches. This change would delay the querying of fixed seeds for one minute when a seednode is specified. So instead of immediately falling back to fixed seeds, the software gives seednodes a chance to provide addresses first.\n\nThe proposal mentions that this change can be tested by running the software with specific command-line arguments and observing the debug log.\n\nThe passage also includes additional sections related to metadata, the review process, and conflicting pull requests. There are comments from reviewers with their feedback and suggestions for the code update.\n\nIn the end, the passage mentions that the proposed changes have been addressed and there is an acknowledgment from the reviewers that the changes look good.

The idea is that users may prefer to gather addresses from this specific peer instead of using the default addresses provided by the software program.\n\nHowever, there is an issue when users disable the default addresses provided by the program (called \"dns seeds\") and specify a seednode using \"-seednode\".

      "summaryeli15": "This is a technical discussion about a feature in a software project. It seems to be related to a change in the way transactions are relayed in the Bitcoin network. Let's go through the discussion and break it down into simpler terms.\n\nThe topic of discussion is the \"mapRelay\" feature, which is used to relay announced transactions that are no longer in the mempool (a storage area for pending transactions). The main issue with mapRelay is not clearly stated, but it seems to have some problems that need to be addressed.\n\nThe discussion suggests that the main reason to care about transactions that have been removed from the mempool is when a peer has requested a transaction and a block containing that transaction has been received in the meantime. In this case, it is beneficial to relay the transaction before the compact block arrives at the peer, potentially saving time and resources.\n\nThere is a proposal to move mapRelay into the txmempool (transaction mempool) so that its size can be counted as part of the overall mempool size limit. This would allow for better control over the size of mapRelay and the mempool. It is also suggested to have a separate data structure for mapRelay to make it easier to manage and prevent potential issues.\n\nThere is a discussion about the benefit of mapRelay overlapping with the mempool. One argument is that it allows for the expiration of transactions based on when they were first announced, rather than when they were received or evicted. Another argument is that the number of transactions announced in a given time period is relatively tightly constrained, so the size of mapRelay can be capped at a few thousand entries.\n\nThere is a concern that trimming mapRelay before the scheduled expiry time may degrade compact block relay when the mempool is full, or result in the loss of fee income if valid mempool transactions are trimmed. It is suggested to use separate and dedicated size limits for mapRelay and the mempool to prevent these issues.\n\nThe discussion also mentions the idea of serving replaced transactions to peers. Some argue that it is better not to relay replaced transactions, as it reduces the chance of relaying the wrong version and spends unnecessary resources. Others suggest including replaced transactions in a reject filter or using the vExtraTxnForCompact vector to continue serving them.\n\nThere is a mention of the need to serve transactions from the most recent block before dropping mapRelay. This is seen as an important functionality to ensure that the most up-to-date transactions are relayed to peers.\n\nOverall, the discussion revolves around the issues and potential improvements regarding the mapRelay feature in the Bitcoin software. There are different perspectives on how to handle transactions that have been removed from the mempool and the benefits and drawbacks of certain approaches. The goal is to find a solution that allows for efficient and reliable transaction relay in the network.",

It is built upon two crates, rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript, which are excellent libraries for working with Bitcoin.\n\nThe developers of the Bitcoin Dev Kit are currently in the process of releasing version 1.0 of the library, which is a fundamental re-write of how the library works. The link provided (https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/road-to-bdk-1/) gives some background information on this project. Although the timeline mentioned in the link may not be accurate, the developers are actively working towards the release.\n\nThe project is organized into several crates, which are essentially separate modules or components of the library. These crates can be found in the /crates directory. There are also fully working examples of how to use these components, located in the /example-crates directory.\n\nThe library is designed to work with any combination of features and requires Rust version 1.57.0 or later to compile. However, if you want to build the library using the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV), you will need to pin some of the dependencies. The specific instructions for pinning the dependencies are provided in the text.\n\nThe last paragraph seems to be unrelated to the previous information and is discussing some updates or fixes made to the library. It mentions specific commit IDs and the actions taken for those commits. These details are more technical and require some understanding of version control systems and specific tools like cargo (the Rust package manager).\n\nOverall, the text is describing the bdk library, its features, organization, and some updates or fixes that have been made to it.",

      "summary": "In this text, the author is referring to a pull request (PR) on GitHub. The PR is related to a project where feedback is received and taken seriously. The author mentions that they read all the feedback and consider user input very seriously.\n\nThe author also mentions that there is documentation available to see all the qualifiers related to the project. They recommend signing up for a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and community for any questions about the project.\n\nThe PR itself solves a specific issue identified as #836. It adds a P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot) descriptor template and a BIP86 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 86) taproot descriptor template. These additions allow users to create a taproot descriptor using templates.\n\nThe author then discusses the confusion they initially had with the PR. They mention that a Mainnet descriptor was matching with a Regtest (Regression Test) address, which seemed incorrect. The explanation provided is that the first network is used for setting the 2nd derivation index of Bipxx (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal), and the second network is used for the address prefix.\n\nThe author suggests two options to address this confusion. The first option is to change the first network to regtest in the build call, while the second option is to change the second network to mainnet. The author believes that the first option, which is a smaller change, can be done in a separate PR.\n\nThey mention that they will open an issue to keep track of this change and plan to work on it soon.\n\nAnother user, @rajarshimaitra, agrees with the initial confusion and suggests going for the author's first option. They mention that a small PR should be created before the end of the week.\n\nThe author, @vladimirfomene, acknowledges the confusion and agrees with the suggested option. They mention that they will work on it and be ready by the next day. They also thank everyone for their work on the project.\n\nHowever, another user, possibly a project administrator or maintainer, intervenes and states that they would like to hold off on merging any new features and only merge critical bug fixes to the release/0.27 branch. It is implied that the author's PR may need to wait for merging.\n\nLater, another user requests the author to rebase their changes after some new bdk_core_staging changes are merged to the master branch. This is to ensure that the PR can be merged into one of the upcoming 1.0.0-alpha releases.\n\nThe author acknowledges the request and mentions that once the changes are merged into the master branch, they will update the PR accordingly.\n\nNext, the author reveals their intention to use TR (Taproot) template for an iOS example app they are working on with another user, @reez. They mention that once the PR is merged into the master branch, they will backport it to a maintenance release.\n\nFinally, the author addresses another user, @notmandatory, informing them that the PR is ready to go and they have created an issue (#992) for fixing the issue raised by @rajarshimaitra.",
      "summaryeli15": "This pull request (PR) is addressing issue #836 on GitHub. The purpose of this PR is to add a P2TR descriptor template and a BIP86 taproot descriptor template. These templates will allow users to create a taproot descriptor more easily.\n\nWhen someone creates a descriptor, they have the option to specify different networks such as Mainnet or Regtest. In this case, the first network is used to set the 2nd derivation index of Bipxx, and the second network is used for the address prefix.\n\nThe confusion arises because a Mainnet descriptor may match with a Regtest address. This is because the first network setting is used for the 2nd derivation index, not for the address prefix. So, if someone uses the same Xpriv (extended private key) but builds with \"build(Network::Regtest)\" and derives the addresses, they will not match up with the test vector.\n\nTo resolve this confusion, there are two options. The first option is to change the first network setting to \"Regtest\" in the build call. This would be a smaller change and can be done in a separate PR. The second option is to change the second network setting to \"Mainnet\". This would require a larger changeset.\n\nThe decision has been made to go with the first option suggested by @rajarshimaitra. A separate PR will be created to make the necessary changes.

      "summary": "This text is a collection of information, instructions, and recommendations related to the Rust Bitcoin library. Here is a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. Feedback: The developers behind the library value user feedback and take it seriously.\n\n2. Qualifiers: The library's documentation provides information on available qualifiers. It is recommended to consult the documentation for more details.\n\n3. Official CLI: The library comes with an official command-line interface (CLI) that allows for fast work. More information about the CLI can be found in the documentation.\n\n4. GitHub Desktop: If there are issues with the CLI, users can try using GitHub Desktop as an alternative.\n\n5. Codespace Preparation: Sometimes, there may be difficulties in preparing the codespace. If this happens, users are encouraged to try again.\n\n6. Library Purpose: The Bitcoin library supports de/serialization, parsing, and execution on data structures and network messages related to Bitcoin.\n\n7. JSONRPC Interaction: For JSONRPC interaction with Bitcoin Core, it is recommended to use the rust-bitcoincore-rpc library.\n\n8. Cargo-Crev Trustworthiness: It is recommended to use cargo-crev to verify the trustworthiness of all dependencies, including the Bitcoin library.\n\n9. Consensus Code: The library should not be used for consensus code, which is responsible for fully validating blockchain data. While the library technically supports this, it is ill-advised due to deviations from the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. Consensus incompatibilities can be addressed through specific patches.\n\n10. 16-bit Pointer Sizes: The library does not support 16-bit pointer sizes. However, if there is a significant interest in this feature, the developers are open to supporting it.\n\n11. Documentation: The library's documentation can be found on docs.rs/bitcoin. The developers highly appreciate patches that add usage examples and expand on the existing documentation.\n\n12. Contributions: Contributions to the library are generally welcome. For larger changes, it is recommended to discuss them in an issue before submitting a pull request to avoid duplicate work and architectural mismatches. Questions and ideas can be discussed in the #bitcoin-rust channel on libera.chat.\n\n13. Compilation: The library should always compile with any combination of features on Rust 1.48.0.\n\n14. Rust Installation: Rust can be installed using a package manager or rustup.rs. Using a package manager is considered more secure, but it's important to note that the distributed Rust version may be outdated. Rust-bitcoin supports older Rust versions compared to the current stable one.\n\n15. Cargo Features: The cargo feature std is enabled by default. At least one of the features std or no-std (or both) must be enabled. Default features can be disabled to exclude std.\n\n16. Lock Files: The library integrates with external libraries, like serde, through feature flags. Two lock files, Cargo-minimal.lock and Cargo-recent.lock, are provided to ensure compatibility and MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) stability. It is the user's responsibility to review the lock files and their content.\n\n17. Fuzz Testing: The library supports unit and integration tests, as well as benchmarks. Contributions to testing efforts are highly appreciated. Tests can be run using `cargo test --all-features`.\n\n18. Rust Compiler Configuration: To run benchmarks, the bench mark code should be guarded with a conditional configuration. Running benchmarks requires the use of the nightly Rust toolchain.\n\n19. Mutation Testing: The library also uses mutagen for mutation testing. To run these tests, mutagen needs to be installed, and the tests should be run with the appropriate flags.\n\n20. CI Approval: Every pull request (PR) requires at least two reviews before being merged. During the review phase, maintainers and contributors may leave comments and request changes. PRs that are not ready for review should be marked with \"WIP\" in the title to indicate they are still in progress.\n\n21. CI Pipeline: The CI pipeline requires approval before running on each merge request (MR).\n\n22. Local CI: To speed up the review process, developers can run the CI pipeline locally using the \"act\" tool. However, note that fuzz and Cross jobs will be skipped due to unsupported caching.\n\n23. Git Hooks: The project provides custom githooks to assist developers in catching errors before running CI. These hooks can be added to the local Git hooks directory or symlinked from the provided githooks directory.\n\n24. Altcoin Support: The library focuses solely on supporting Bitcoin and does not provide support for any altcoins.\n\n25. Code License: The code in this project is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license, as indicated by SPDX IDs.\n\nThe text also includes specific instructions and commands related to updating dependencies, cloning the repository, building, testing, and running documentation generation.\n\nOverall, this detailed information aims to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the library, its capabilities, guidelines, and best practices.",

      "summary": "The given text appears to be a part of a software development project and includes information about feedback, input from users, and default values for service flags.\n\nFirstly, it mentions that every piece of feedback is read and the input from users is taken very seriously. This indicates that the project team values the opinions and suggestions of the users and considers them important.\n\nThe text also mentions documentation where all available qualifiers can be found. This suggests that there is a specific document or set of materials that provides information about the project, its features, and various qualifiers related to it.\n\nAdditionally, the text references the availability of a free GitHub account to open an issue and contact maintainers and the community. This implies that there is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, and users can sign up for an account to participate, ask questions, and report any issues or problems they encounter.\n\nThere is a mention of \"NONE/empty service flags\" as a default value. It is indicated that this default value is considered reasonable. Service flags are commonly used in software development to enable or disable certain functionalities or features. The \"NONE\" value suggests that no services are supported or enabled by default. The text is questioning whether having no services as a default value is appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions that the reason for a comment will be displayed to describe it to others. This suggests that comments or explanations provided in the project are intended to be visible and understood by other users or contributors. It also mentions there is an opportunity to learn more about this feature.\n\nLastly, there is a mention that merging a pull request may close certain issues. This indicates that the project uses a system where users can submit changes or additions to the project's codebase, known as pull requests. The successful merging of a pull request can potentially resolve or address specific issues that have been reported.\n\nIn summary, the given text provides details about feedback, user input, default values for service flags, and the project's development process. It also references documentation, open-source participation, and the potential resolution of issues through pull requests.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this code snippet, there is a definition for a structure called `ServiceFlags`, which is used to represent different service flags. The `ServiceFlags` structure has a constant member called `NONE`, which represents the case where no services are supported. \n\nThe constant `NONE` is assigned a value of `ServiceFlags(0)`. This means that when using the `ServiceFlags` structure and setting the value to `NONE`, it will have a value of 0. \n\nIn computer programming, it is common to use default values for variables or data structures when there is no specific value provided. In this case, `0` is chosen as the default value for the `ServiceFlags` structure.\n\nAs a 15-year-old, you might be curious as to why `0` was chosen as a default value. Well, `0` is a common default value because it has a special property in computer systems. When a variable is set to `0`, it usually means that the variable is empty or has no meaningful value assigned to it. Therefore, using `0` as the default value for the `ServiceFlags` structure indicates that no services are supported.\n\nUsing a default value for `NONE` is helpful because it ensures that the program is well-defined even if no specific service flag is set. It also allows for simpler code writing, as there is no need to explicitly define a default value in every instance where `ServiceFlags` is used.\n\nAdditionally, if you have any questions or need to report issues related to this code, you can sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to communicate with the maintainers and the community. They take your input and feedback seriously, as they want to improve and make the code better based on the input received.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the code and its purpose.",

      "summary": "Core Lightning is a Lightning Network implementation that is focused on adhering to the Lightning Network protocol and providing high performance. It is lightweight and customizable, allowing users to configure it according to their needs.\n\nThe implementation has been in use on the Bitcoin mainnet since early 2018, specifically with the launch of the Blockstream Store. While it is recommended to initially experiment with Core Lightning on testnet or regtest, it is considered stable enough to be used safely on the mainnet.\n\nThe development team behind Core Lightning values user feedback and takes it seriously. They encourage users to share their feedback and report any bugs or issues they encounter. Users can reach out to the team through various channels such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, or Telegram.\n\nCore Lightning is only compatible with Linux and macOS operating systems. Additionally, it requires a locally or remotely running bitcoind (version 0.16 or above) that is fully synchronized with the network. The bitcoind instance must also relay transactions. Partial support is available for pruning, but specific details can be found in the provided documentation.\n\nTo experiment with Core Lightning using the lightningd component, there is a script available called startup_regtest.sh. This script sets up a local test network with two lightning nodes connected to each other. It also provides a helper function called start_ln. More information on how to use this script can be found in the notes at the top of the startup_regtest.sh file.\n\nWhen using Core Lightning, it is recommended to configure your node to expose developer options for improved responsiveness. These developer options can be accessed through the command line interface.\n\nFor testing with real Bitcoin, users need to have a local bitcoind node running. It is important to ensure that the bitcoind node is synchronized with the Bitcoin network. Users should also verify that they do not have walletbroadcast=0 in their bitcoin.conf file to avoid any potential issues. Running lightningd against a pruned node may cause problems if not handled carefully.\n\nCore Lightning exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket. Users can access this interface using the lightning-cli tool or a Python client library. The available RPC methods can be listed using the lightning-cli help command. Further details on specific commands can be obtained by running lightning-cli help followed by the command name.\n\nOnce starting Core Lightning for the first time, users can connect to other nodes on the Lightning network using the bootstrap-node.sh script. This script facilitates the connection process.\n\nPlugins are available for Core Lightning, which enhance its capabilities. A collection of plugins can be found on GitHub. One noteworthy plugin is \"helpme,\" which assists in setting up channels and customizing the node.\n\nTo ensure lightningd has funds available to open a channel, users need to transfer some funds to lightningd. The funds will be registered once the transaction is confirmed. If the faucet does not support bech32 addresses, users may need to generate a p2sh-segwit address to receive the funds.\n\nAfter lightningd has funds, users can connect to another node and open a channel. This involves establishing a connection and then opening a channel on top of that connection. The funding transaction requires confirmation from the Bitcoin network before the channel can be utilized. Users can check the status of the channel using the lightning-cli listpeers command and verify the public field using the lightning-cli listchannels command.\n\nPayments within the Lightning Network are invoice-based. The recipient generates an invoice specifying the expected amount, and the payer uses this invoice to make the payment. The invoice is encoded in a standard format called bolt11. The sender can decode the bolt11 string using the decodepay command and initiate the payment using the pay command.\n\nConfiguration options for lightningd can be passed through the command line or a configuration file. Command line options always take precedence over values in the configuration file. To use a configuration file, users can create a file named \"config\" within the lightning directory. A sample configuration file is provided as an example.\n\nThe hsm_secret content, which is used to derive the HD wallet's master key, can be encrypted for added security. Encryption can be done by passing the \"--encrypted-hsm\" startup argument or using the provided hsmtool with the encrypt method. The encrypted hsm_secret can be decrypted using the hsmtool with the decrypt method.\n\nDevelopers interested in contributing to Core Lightning can refer to the developer guide for more information. It is recommended to configure with \"--enable-developer\" during the setup process to enable additional checks and options.\n\nIn summary, Core Lightning is a Lightning Network implementation that focuses on complying with the Lightning Network protocol and delivering superior performance. It is compatible with Linux and macOS and requires a running bitcoind node. Users can connect to other nodes, open channels, and make payments using the lightning-cli tool. The implementation is stable for use on the Bitcoin mainnet and welcomes user feedback and contributions from developers.",
      "summaryeli15": "Core Lightning is a software implementation of the Lightning Network protocol, which is a scaling solution for the Bitcoin network. The Lightning Network allows for faster and cheaper transactions by creating off-chain payment channels between parties. \n\nCore Lightning, previously known as c-lightning, is designed to be lightweight, highly customizable, and compliant with the Lightning Network specifications. It has been in production use on the Bitcoin mainnet since 2018. While it is recommended to experiment on test networks first, the implementation is stable and can be safely used on the mainnet.\n\nThe development team behind Core Lightning welcomes assistance in testing the implementation, reporting bugs, and addressing any outstanding issues. They can be reached through various communication channels, such as IRC, mailing lists, Discord, and Telegram.\n\nIt's important to note that Core Lightning currently only supports Linux and macOS operating systems. Additionally, it requires a locally or remotely running bitcoind (version 0.16 or above) that is fully synchronized with the network. Transactions must be relayed, and pruning is partially supported.\n\nTo begin experimenting with Core Lightning, you can set up a regtest test network of two local lightning nodes using a script provided. This script also offers a convenient start_ln helper. It's recommended to configure your node to expose developer options for a faster and more responsive experience.\n\nTo test with real Bitcoin, you need to have a local bitcoind node running and fully synchronized with the network. Make sure walletbroadcast is not set to 0 in your bitcoin.conf file to avoid any issues. Running Core Lightning against a pruned node may cause complications if not managed carefully.\n\nOnce you have set up the necessary requirements, you can start lightningd (the Core Lightning daemon) with a command. This command creates a .lightning/ subdirectory in your home directory, where you can find more runtime options in the documentation.\n\nCore Lightning provides a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over a Unix Domain socket, which allows you to interact with lightningd. You can use the lightning-cli tool or a Python client library to access this interface. By using the lightning-cli help command, you can get a list of available RPC methods and detailed information about each command.\n\nThe implementation also supports various plugins that add additional capabilities to Core Lightning. You can find a collection of plugins on GitHub. One notable plugin is helpme, which assists you in setting up your first channels and customizing your node.\n\nTo start using Core Lightning, you need to transfer funds to lightningd so that it can open a payment channel. Once the transaction is confirmed, lightningd registers the funds. If the faucet you are using does not support bech32 addresses, you may need to generate a p2sh-segwit address.\n\nAfter getting funds into lightningd, you can connect to another node and open a payment channel. This involves specifying the remote node's address and node ID. The funding transaction requires three confirmations for the channel to be usable, and six confirmations to be publicly announced for others to use. You can check the status of the channel using lightning-cli listpeers and lightning-cli listchannels commands.\n\nIn the Lightning Network, payments are invoice-based. The recipient generates an invoice with the expected amount, and the payer can use the bolt11 string to make the payment. By using the lightning-cli decodepay command, the sender can see the details of the invoice before paying it with the lightning-cli pay command. There are also lower-level interfaces and more options available for more advanced use cases.\n\nWhen configuring lightningd, you can pass options via the command line or use a configuration file. Command line options take precedence over values in the configuration file. To use a configuration file, create a file named config within your lightning directory or network subdirectory. A sample configuration file is provided, and you can find its location in the documentation.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the development of Core Lightning, there is a developer guide available. It's recommended to configure with the --enable-developer option to enable additional checks and options for development purposes.\n\nOverall, Core Lightning is a reliable, high-performance Lightning Network implementation for the Bitcoin network, and the development team encourages users to provide feedback, assist in testing, and contribute to its ongoing improvement.",

They think this would be a difficult and impossible task.\n\nThey mention that the \"listconfigs\" feature now displays plugin options as expected. However, there is some confusion about the ordering and structure of the output when using the \"--allow-deprecated-apis=false\" option. They ask if the current output structure and ordering were intentional.\n\nThe author suggests adding information about which plugin each option belongs to in the output of \"listconfigs.\" They think this would make the options more understandable. They propose adding a plugin array to the \"configs\" object, which would contain the path and options array.\n\nFinally, the author mentions an off-topic suggestion. They think it would be helpful for users to be able to see more default values for options.

      "summary": "In the given text, the author is discussing a proposed change in the way core lightning interacts with the blockchain. Currently, when core lightning requests information about the blockchain using the `getchaininfo` command, it already knows the minimum and maximum block heights.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when a smarter Bitcoin backend is used that can switch between different clients. In these cases, it would be helpful for lightningd (core lightning) to provide information about the current known block height and pass it down to the plugin.\n\nThis information is valuable because the plugin can then determine the correct known height from lightningd and try to fix any problems that may arise. This is particularly useful when syncing a new backend from scratch, such as with the cloudhead/nakamoto project. By avoiding returning the lower height from the known, the crash of core lightning can be prevented.\n\nWith this added information, the plugin can start syncing the chain and only return the answer back when the chain is in sync with the current status of lightningd. This allows for smoother integration of different backends.\n\nThe author suggests that waiting for bitcoind (Bitcoin Core) to catch up with the expected block height could be a solution, but notes that Bitcoin Core's syncing process is extremely slow. The duration of the wait would depend on various factors, making it unclear how long to wait.\n\nThe proposed solution is to inform the plugin about the height, allowing it to start syncing while the previous backend catches up. This way, the plugin is not left in the dark when requesting `getchaininfo`, and it has the option to wait for the blockchain sync or dispatch the request to another backend.\n\nThe author mentions their specific case of integrating a BIP 157 compatible backend, where waiting for the height takes a maximum of a couple of minutes compared to Bitcoin Core's syncing process.\n\nThey offer to work on a solution within core lightning if it is deemed necessary.\n\nThe remaining parts of the text seem to be related to the specific implementation of the proposed changes, including references to pull requests, documentation updates, and code reviews.",

Eclair follows the Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs) and is developed in Scala, a programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nThe purpose of Eclair is to provide a feature-rich HTTP API that makes it easy for developers to integrate Lightning Network functionality into their applications. The API documentation website provides detailed information on how to use the API.\n\nIt's important to note that Eclair's JSON API should not be accessible from the outside world, similar to the Bitcoin Core API. This is for security reasons.\n\nEclair relies on Bitcoin Core, another software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, to interface with and monitor the blockchain. Eclair does not include an on-chain wallet, and instead relies on your Bitcoin Core node for managing funds. This means that channel opening transactions are funded by your Bitcoin Core node, and when a channel is closed, the funds are returned to your Bitcoin Core node.\n\nBecause Eclair relies on Bitcoin Core, it has certain requirements on how your Bitcoin Core node should be configured. You'll need to run bitcoind (the Bitcoin Core software) with a specific bitcoin.conf configuration file. Eclair also benefits from the verifications and optimizations implemented by Bitcoin Core, such as fee management.\n\nTo run Eclair, you'll need to install Java (specifically, OpenJDK 11 is recommended) and then download the latest release of Eclair. After unzipping the archive, you can run Eclair using the provided command. You can control your node either through the eclair-cli command line tool or via the API.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly read the official Eclair documentation before running your own node, as tutorials or guides may be outdated or incomplete.\n\nEclair uses a configuration file named eclair.conf, which is located in the ~/.eclair directory by default. You can change the configuration by creating a file named eclair.conf in the same directory. The documentation provides an example configuration file with various parameters that you can tweak.\n\nEclair uses logback for logging, and you can customize the logging configuration by overriding the internal logback.xml file.\n\nWhen running Eclair, it's important to backup both your Bitcoin Core wallet and your Eclair node. The Bitcoin Core wallet file needs to be backed up when it is created, and the Eclair node database file (eclair.sqlite.bak) should be regularly backed up. You can create a cron task or use a notification script to automate the backup process.\n\nIf you want to run Eclair in a Docker container, there is a Dockerfile available for x86_64 platforms. You can use the JAVA_OPTS environment variable to set arguments to the eclair-node command.\n\nEclair also supports plugins that can be written in Scala, Java, or any JVM-compatible language. These plugins are implemented as jar files and require certain manifest entries.\n\nBy default, Eclair is configured to run on the mainnet (Bitcoin's main network), but you can also run it on testnet, regtest, or signet. To run on a different network, you need to modify the configuration files for both Bitcoin Core and Eclair.\n\nOverall, Eclair is a powerful tool for developers who want to integrate Lightning Network functionality into their applications. It provides an API, various configuration options, and relies on Bitcoin Core for blockchain interactions and fund management. Thoroughly reading the documentation is important to ensure proper setup and usage of Eclair.",

It states that this PR aims to allow access to historic channel data without relying on third-party services. LN explorers are likely external services used for exploring the Lightning Network, a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n5. The paragraph also mentions that the API, which is presumably being modified or added in the PR, is strictly for managing the node. It implies that the primary purpose of the API is to provide control over the node rather than serving exotic use-cases or data analysis.\n\n6. The following sentence acknowledges that there is an external link shared in the PR, which refers to the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter.

It implies that the modifications made will ensure that user privacy is not compromised.\n\n8. After reiterating that the API is for managing the node, the paragraph continues to emphasize that the development team does not want to maintain unnecessary or unused APIs. This suggests that they want to keep the API ecosystem clean and not cluttered with unnecessary features.\n\n9. The next part interjects with a question from the submitter about the need to label some use-cases or analysis as \"exotic.\" They argue that knowing what happened with one's own money is an essential part of managing the node. This indicates that the developer considers the ability to access historic channel data as a fundamental requirement.\n\n10. The submitter then mentions that the necessary code and data already exist and that only a few lines of code are needed to combine them. This suggests that the changes in the PR are not major, but rather a matter of combining existing components.\n\n11. The following paragraph reiterates the suggestion of accessing the database directly. It acknowledges that JSON format documentation might not be available, but suggests that one can make use of their intelligence to figure out the structure. This implies that the submitter is proposing using JSON data stored in a database, likely SQLite, available for analysis.\n\n12. The submitter mentions that they use Python for their automation scripts and asks for guidance on how to write a script that can determine if a channel has been force closed using the provided data. This suggests that they want assistance in utilizing the JSON data from the database for their Python scripts.\n\n13. The next paragraph acknowledges the concern about listing all closed channels at once, as the list could become very large. They propose adding pagination functionality and making the count parameter mandatory, which would allow users to retrieve the closed channels in smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\n14. The paragraph that follows appears to be an automated message from a service that analyzes the code coverage of the PR. It informs the submitter that merging the PR will increase the coverage by 0.00%. It also provides details about the files, lines, and branches affected by the changes in the PR.\n\n15. The next message is an alert about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration, implying that there may be a degradation in service starting from May 15th. They recommend installing the GitHub App Integration for the organization to avoid any issues. \n\n16. The subsequent paragraph seems to be a comment from a reviewer or maintainer of the project. They mention that performance concerns for nodes with a significant amount of historical data can be addressed later and suggest optimizing by moving closed channels to a separate table. This implies that they are concerned about the potential impact on performance due to the large amount of data in the closed channels list.\n\n17. The next message is another comment from a reviewer or maintainer. They mention that they have a few comments specifically related to changes in the DB files, but overall, the changes in the PR look good to them. This suggests that the reviewer's comments are mainly focused on the database-related aspects of the changes.\n\n18. The subsequent message indicates that the pull request has been successfully merged. It also provides a link to the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter, indicating that the PR has been mentioned in it.\n\n19. The final paragraph appears to be a release note or changelog. It provides a list of API changes introduced in the release, explaining the modifications made to various commands or functionalities. These changes include adding new parameters, removing arguments, updating websocket events, and introducing new commands for listing payments, channels, and transaction-related functionality.\n\nOverall, the given information seems to be a collection of different messages and comments related to a specific software project and its pull request. It covers aspects such as feedback, documentation, accessing historical data, API changes, scripting, performance, and release notes.",
      "summaryeli15": "This Pull Request (PR) proposes a new feature that allows users to access the historic channel data of their node without relying on third-party services like Lightning Network explorers. The API provided in this PR is strictly for managing the node, and the developers do not want to introduce too many unused APIs. They suggest that more exotic use-cases or analysis should be performed directly on the database, preferably on a read-only replicated version to avoid impacting the running node.\n\nThe main motivation for this PR is to provide users with more control over their node and to retain their privacy. By accessing the historic channel data, users can have a better understanding of what happened with their money and manage their node more effectively. It is mentioned that the code and data for this feature already exist, and only a few lines of code are needed to put them together.\n\nThe author of this PR also highlights that the feature has gained attention and recognition in the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter, which could potentially make them as famous as Rusty Russell, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin community.\n\nIn one of the comments, the author mentions that accessing the database directly has been suggested before, but there are two problems associated with it. The first problem is that the JSON format of the data is not documented, but one can use their natural or artificial intelligence to figure out the structure. The second problem is related to writing a script in Python to determine if a channel was force closed using this data.\n\nThere is a discussion about the list of closed channels and its potential impact on performance. The suggestion is to add pagination and make the count parameter mandatory to avoid listing everything at once, which could be problematic for large lists. It is acknowledged that nodes with too much historical data might experience performance issues, but it is suggested to optimize it later by moving closed channels to their own table.\n\nThe conversation shifts to a coverage report showing that merging this PR will increase the code coverage by 0.00%. There is also a notification about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration, which could result in degraded service starting from May 15th.\n\nAnother comment mentions that there are a few comments on the changes made to the DB files but overall, the PR looks good.\n\nThe final comment announces the successful merging of this PR and provides a link to the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter that covers the feature. It also mentions that merging this PR may close some related issues.\n\nFinally, there is a release announcement that includes several API changes and additions, including the new \"closedchannels\" API that lists closed channels with optional parameters for limiting the number of retrieved items.",

They also encourage users to check the project documentation to see all the available qualifiers. Additionally, they provide a way for users to ask questions about the project by signing up for a GitHub account and opening an issue.\n\nNext, the author mentions a specific update related to the postman and the router. The postman can now ask the router to find a route using channels only. This route is also used as a reply path when necessary.\n\nThe author then mentions a merge request (#2656) that, if merged into the master branch, will increase the coverage of the project by 0.08%. They also provide information about the diff coverage, which is 95.39%.\n\nThe author gives a warning that the organization is not currently using the GitHub App Integration and that this might result in degraded service starting from May 15th. They advise installing the GitHub App Integration for the organization to avoid any issues. \n\nThe author shares their reflections on the complexity of the project and proposes some simplifications and refactorings in another merge request (#2663). They mention that they are getting closer to releasing a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nThey clarify that they have merged improvements but have kept a separate routing algorithm for messages and payments. They believe that routing messages is too different to be solved by the current payment routing algorithm and find it easier to separate the two instead of trying to make something generic.\n\nThe author states that they are now using Dijkstra for message routing as well. They explain that they prioritize big channels, old channels, and penalize disabled edges (although they can still consider them). They also mention that they had to rebase on the master branch to resolve a conflict.\n\nThe author expresses some concerns about potential performance regressions and the critical nature of the component being worked on. They suggest not including the pull request (PR) in the current release and instead spending time testing it on their node before releasing it. They plan to make the release first and then merge the PR to the master branch.\n\nThey provide some performance benchmarks for certain parts of the code. They mention how the time taken for specific functions has changed compared to before the changes. For example, DirectedGraph.makeGraph now takes 653ms instead of 225ms and .addEdges now takes 356ms instead of 2.676s. They note both improvements and regressions in the code's performance.\n\nThe author gives their opinion that writing ad hoc code for DirectedGraph.makeGraph is not worth it because it is only called once at startup. They state that storing edges in a map instead of a list has resulted in a 10% increase in path-finding time but a 10x improvement on the update side.\n\nThe author praises the code and compliments the work done. They mention that they will spend more time on the benchmarks and will provide a report early next week.\n\nFinally, the author mentions that successfully merging this PR may close some open issues.

They are talking about improvements to the code, testings, and benchmarks.\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, someone mentions that a feature has been added to allow the postman (a term used to refer to a component in the system) to ask the router (another component) to find a route using channels only. This route is used for sending messages and can also be used as a reply path.\n\nThen, someone mentions a specific code change or \"pull request\" with a reference number (#2656) that is being merged into the main codebase or \"master\". This change is expected to increase the test coverage by 0.08%. The text also mentions the \"diff coverage\", which refers to the percentage of the code that has changed in this pull request, which is currently at 95.39%. The participants are emphasizing that they take user feedback seriously and are actively working on improving the project based on that feedback.\n\nNext, there is a warning message that the organization is not using a specific integration with GitHub, and as a result, there may be some degradation in service starting from May 15th. They recommend installing the GitHub App Integration to avoid this.\n\nAfter that, someone mentions that the project has turned out to be more complex than expected, but they have proposed some simplifications and refactorings to make it easier. They mention that they are closer to releasing a minimum viable product (MVP), which refers to a version of the project that has enough features to be usable.\n\nThen, someone shares that they have merged the improvements proposed by another person, but they kept a separate routing algorithm for messages and payments because they found it simpler than trying to make a generic solution that works for both. They mention that they are now using Dijkstra's algorithm for message routing, which is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. They also mention some factors that they consider while routing messages, such as prioritizing big channels, old channels, and penalizing disabled edges. They mention that they had to resolve some conflicts when merging the code with the main codebase.\n\nFollowing that, someone expresses their concern about potential performance regressions in the code and suggests spending more time testing it on their node (part of the system) before releasing it. They suggest making the release first and then merging the code into the main codebase after the release, along with conducting performance benchmarks.\n\nThen, someone shares some performance measurements comparing the time taken by certain functions before and after the changes. They mention the time taken by the DirectedGraph.makeGraph function has increased from 225ms to 653ms (2.9 times slower), addEdges function has decreased from 2.676s to 356ms (around 8 times faster), and yenKshortestPaths function takes 2.578s compared to 2.345s (around 1.1 times slower) for finding paths. They also mention an optimization related to storing edges in a map instead of a list, which has some trade-offs in terms of path-finding and update speed.\n\nAfter that, someone compliments the code and the work done by another person, mentioning that it is looking good. They mention that they will spend more time on the benchmarks and report the results early next week.\n\nFinally, the text mentions that successfully merging this pull request may resolve some issues (bug reports or feature requests) that are listed there.

The conversation includes several comments, discussions, and suggestions between the participants. Here is a detailed breakdown of the conversation:\n\n- The initial statement mentions that every piece of feedback is read and taken seriously. It also mentions that more information about the project can be found in the documentation, and users can sign up for a GitHub account to open an issue and contact the maintainers and community. Clicking \"Sign up for GitHub\" means agreeing to the terms of service and privacy statement, and occasionally receiving account-related emails.\n\n- The conversation then moves on to discussing the design of channels. Currently, funded and unfunded channels are represented by a single Channel struct. This leads to certain issues, as it makes it harder to reason about and less safe to call appropriate methods on Channel to advance state.\n\n- One suggestion is to drop the ChannelKind enum and instead have three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager.\n\n- Another suggestion is to split the code into multiple smaller commits to make it easier to review.\n\n- The participants discuss coordinating the process of landing the changes to avoid conflicts. They suggest getting concept ACKs, and then all being online at the same time to work on landing the changes.\n\n- There is a repetition of the suggestion to drop the ChannelKind enum and use separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager.\n\n- One participant mentions that they initially started with the approach of having separate maps for channels, but encountered some issues when promoting a channel while concurrently handling a second map. They will split the changes based on the suggestion and see how much more complex the enum makes the code.\n\n- There is a discussion about interior mutability and its relevance when converting from one channel to another. The participants try to determine why interior mutability is cropping up in the code.\n\n- The suggestion is made to split the code into multiple commits to make it more readable.\n\n- There is a request for an explanation of why the current design is still suitable for dual-funding. The suggestion is made to change the struct names from inbound/outbound to InitiatorChannel and InitiateeChannel. The participants discuss whether there is sufficient functionality overlap between the initiator and initiatee sides to have only one PreFundingChannel struct.\n\n- One participant mentions that the refactoring of channels turned out to be trickier than anticipated.\n\n- The suggestion is made to have three stages for channels: the pre-funding stage, the post-funding stage, and the operation stage. This would allow for better separation of channel states and operations.\n\n- It is mentioned that the changes regarding the three stages will be addressed in a future pull request.\n\n- The code is reviewed, and the suggestion is made to track all follow-up items in an issue to ensure they are not forgotten and can be prioritized for the next release.\n\n- The discussion continues with several suggestions and minor code changes.\n\n- The suggestion is made to address some issues in a follow-up to handle warn/ignore cases properly.\n\n- There is a suggestion to unify the various code paths for closing channels and to clean up the code.\n\n- The suggestion is made to condense or inline certain code to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n- The code changes are reviewed, and it is mentioned that merging the pull request may close some issues.\n\n- The coverage report is analyzed, and it shows a slight decrease in coverage.\n\nOverall, the conversation revolves around the design and implementation of channels in the project. The participants discuss various suggestions, review the code, and plan for future improvements and bug fixes.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this discussion, a group of people are discussing the design and implementation of a software project related to channels. They are discussing various aspects of the project and providing feedback and suggestions to improve it.\n\nThe first part of the discussion is about the current implementation of channels and their representation in the code. The channels are currently represented by a single struct called \"Channel\", which conveys both funded and unfunded channels. This is causing some confusion and making it difficult to reason about the state and call appropriate methods on the Channel struct. \n\nOne suggestion proposed is to drop the ChannelKind enum and instead have three separate maps for channels in the ChannelManager. This would allow for better separation of state and make it easier to work with and reason about the channels.\n\nThere is also a suggestion to split the implementation into separate commits, to make it easier to review and understand. The suggestion is to first create the context object in a regular channel, then add the trait, and finally split any remaining code. \n\nThere is a request to coordinate the landing of the code, as it is expected to conflict with other changes in the codebase. The suggestion is to get conceptual approval from other team members, then have everyone online at the same time for a few hours to get the changes landed.\n\nThe discussion continues with a consideration of the pros and cons of dropping the ChannelKind enum. The initial approach was to have separate maps for different types of channels, but it became concerning when dealing with a second map while simultaneously handling an occupied entry. The suggestion is to follow the initial approach and split the implementation as suggested.\n\nThere is a question about why interior mutability is cropping up and causing issues. The response suggests that it may be happening with methods that read from the context via a getter, and suggests using \"&mut self\" in the method signature to avoid RefCell.\n\nThe discussion then turns to the need for a quick explainer on why the current design is still the right choice in dual-funding scenarios. It is suggested to use different struct names, such as InitiatorChannel and InitiateeChannel, instead of inbound and outbound, and to determine if there is sufficient functionality overlap between the initiator and initiatee sides to use the same PreFundingChannel.\n\nThe discussion continues with concerns about the complexity and bugs that can arise from refactoring the channel code. It is suggested that having separate maps for channels may reduce the surface area for bugs, as there would be less code to touch.\n\nThere is a consideration of whether to have a single struct for prefunded channels, with information about the initiator stored in the context, or to have separate structs for different types of channels. The conclusion is that it would be better to have different structs for different types of channels, as it would provide type-safety around methods that do not overlap.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the potential introduction of different states in the channel lifecycle, such as a pre-funding stage, a post-funding stage without the channel_ready exchange, and an operation stage. This would allow for a more fine-grained control of the channels and prevent access to certain functionalities until the channel is ready.\n\nThere are suggestions to open follow-up issues to track the various improvements and bugs identified in the discussion, and to ensure they are addressed before the next release.\n\nOverall, the discussion is focused on improving the design and implementation of channels in the software project, addressing issues of code structure, state management, and functionality overlap. The participants are actively discussing and providing feedback to find the best solution.",

      "summaryeli15": "In this pull request, the goal is to allow users to easily bump their commitments and HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract) transactions without having to worry about all the details involved in the process. To achieve this, the code introduces a new trait called `CoinSelectionSource`, which users can implement to grant permission for the event handler to spend their confirmed UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) for the transactions it will produce.\n\nThe `CoinSelectionSource` trait provides a transaction \"template\" that the event handler can complete and finalize by selecting specific inputs and outputs, signing the transaction, and broadcasting it to the network. By implementing this trait, users have control over how their UTXOs are selected and used in the transactions.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the `CoinSelectionSource` trait may not always produce relayable transactions due to certain Replace-By-Fee (RBF) mempool policy requirements. RBF allows users to replace one transaction with another by increasing the feerate (transaction fee per unit of weight) or absolute fee of the replacement transaction. To ensure that the transactions produced by the event handler adhere to these requirements, the code proposes a 25% feerate increase for each new bumping attempt. This helps the transactions to propagate in the mempool under constrained circumstances.\n\nIn addition to the `CoinSelectionSource` trait, the code introduces another trait called `WalletSource` as an alternative for users who may not have control over the UTXO selection process or do not want to implement the full `CoinSelectionSource` trait. The `WalletSource` trait allows users to simply provide the set of confirmed UTXOs that may be used, and this implementation is consumed into a wrapper `Wallet` that implements the `CoinSelectionSource` trait using a default coin selection algorithm.\n\nOverall, this pull request aims to simplify the process of bumping commitments and HTLC transactions by providing an interface for users to easily control their UTXO selection and allowing them to leverage their own wallet or UTXO source. It also takes into account RBF mempool policy requirements to ensure that the produced transactions are relayable.",

They recommend installing the GitHub App Integration for the organization.\n\nThey mention that they should include new serialization backwards-incompatible hints for the next release. They discuss the possibility of using a certain path directly or adding a TODO for it. They explain that they can't use certain paths at the moment because the get_route function doesn't have the ability to advance the blinded path to the next hop. They propose a solution where get_route returns an unblinded path portion and the blinded tail, which can be handled by the paying code.\n\nThey discuss potential issues with this solution, such as the maximum HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contract) of a blinded hint not being sufficient for the entire payment. They propose pre-selecting the path and running the router to select more paths if needed.\n\nThey mention the need for a prefactor and the presence of assumptions around the length of the path. They plan to address this in a follow-up.\n\nThey discuss decrementing the available channel balances by the amount used on the path and the additional complexity it may introduce. They mention addressing this in a follow-up.\n\nThey talk about the inclusion of a dummy hop and whether the recipient can make the sender overpay. They explain that dummy hops don't cost extra fees and the aggregated fees for the blinded path are calculated based on the non-dummy hops' feerates. However, they note that the recipient could add extra fees on top of the aggregated fees, potentially causing the sender to overpay.\n\nThey mention that the last commit needs a more detailed pass.

      "summary": "This text appears to be a conversation or discussion among multiple individuals regarding a software project. They are discussing the implementation of a feature called MPP keysend, which supports sending and receiving keysend payments with payment secrets. Here is a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. The team reads and takes feedback seriously. They encourage users to provide input and have documentation available for more information.\n\n2. The team is working on implementing support for sending and receiving MPP keysend.\n\n3. Some implementations reject keysend payments with payment secrets, so the team communicates this to users through RecipientOnionFields.\n\n4. There is no clear way to determine if a node supports MPP keysend, so the team leaves it up to the user to decide when to use it.\n\n5. MPP keysend requires a payment secret, which was not previously included in PendingHTLCRouting::ReceiveKeysend. Downgrading can break deserialization, so a new flag UserConfig::accept_mpp_keysend is added to allow users to opt-in to receive support.\n\n6. The patch coverage is 95.63% and the project coverage change is +0.96.\n\n7. There is a note about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration, which may result in degraded service starting May 15th. They recommend installing the Github App Integration.\n\n8. There is a suggestion to simplify the code by making changes to \"process_pending_htlc_forwards\" function.\n\n9. There is a discussion about whether to override the sender-provided RecipientOnionFields::payment_secret for keysend payments. Some suggest that payment secret should only be included for multi-part keysend, while others argue for supporting custom TLVs and including the payment secret for keysend. The issue is complicated because some implementations reject keysend with payment secrets.\n\n10. There is a proposal to have a separate method or constructor for lnd-compatible keysend. There is also a suggestion to consider upstreaming the change to lnd.\n\n11. There is a question about supporting sending MPP keysends or only receiving. The team agrees that sending should be supported but should be clearly documented.\n\n12. There is a discussion about the routing code and the possibility of using a multi-part route for a payee that doesn't support MPP keysend. It is mentioned that if the payee info indicates MPP support, a multi-path route may be used, otherwise a single-path route or failure.\n\n13. There is a suggestion to update InvoiceFeatures::for_keysend to set mpp as optional.\n\n14. There are multiple comments acknowledging the delay in reviewing and making changes to the code. The changes are squash and the commit messages are rewritten to be more intuitive.\n\n15. The changes are approved with the request to squash the commits into a clean git history.\n\n16. The changes are squashed and the fixup commits are removed.\n\n17. The changes are approved by another reviewer with the request to squash again for another review.\n\n18.

      "summaryeli15": "This is a collection of comments and changes made in a GitHub pull request for a project. It seems that the pull request is related to implementing support for sending and receiving MPP (Multi-Path Payment) keysend. \n\nThe pull request starts by mentioning that some implementations reject keysend payments with payment secrets (the previous implementation did this as well). To address this, the changes communicate to the user in the `RecipientOnionFields` that they should be aware of this limitation.\n\nThe pull request also mentions that there is no great way to signal or determine if a node supports MPP keysend, so the decision of when to route or send MPP keysend payments is left up to the user.\n\nThe pull request then discusses some technical details. It mentions that MPP keysend requires a payment secret, which was not included in the `PendingHTLCRouting::ReceiveKeysend` before this pull request. This change can break the deserialization of the `ChannelManager` when downgrading, so a new flag `UserConfig::accept_mpp_keysend` is added to allow the user to opt-in to receive support for MPP keysend.\n\nThe pull request also mentions the patch coverage and project coverage changes, as well as a notification about the GitHub App Integration used by the organization.\n\nThere are some comments in the pull request discussing different aspects of the implementation. Some of the comments mention the need to check that all parts of a keysend have the same payment secret, the possibility of conflicting with passing payment metadata through the receive pipeline, and the decision of whether to validate the payment secret or not.\n\nAnother comment suggests consolidating some logic in the `process_pending_htlc_forwards` function and mentions another pull request that may be related to this.\n\nThere are also some discussions about how to handle the `RecipientOnionFields::payment_secret` in spontaneous payments, the support for MPP keysend in different implementations (specifically lnd), the detection of MPP keysend support, and the preferred routing method when the payee doesn't support MPP keysend.\n\nThe pull request ends with some comments about planned changes, the need for squashing fixup commits, and the final approval of the changes by reviewers.\n\nOverall, this pull request introduces support for sending and receiving MPP keysend payments, handles different cases, and addresses some compatibility and validation issues.

The code adds support for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages and replying to onion messages in a more general way.\n5. A follow-up (#2371) implements the OffersMessageHandler for the ChannelManager.\n6. Patch coverage is reported as 75.88% and the project coverage change is +1.07, which is a positive improvement.\n7. The code comparison shows that the base has 90.48% coverage compared to the head, which has 91.56% coverage.\n8. There are some warnings and recommendations regarding using the GitHub App Integration for organizations and uploading reports for more accurate results.\n9. The TLV types have been checked against the specification and a brief review has been done to brush up on the specifications.\n10. The code is new and the author hopes that the suggestions made make sense.\n11. There is a discussion about making it clearer that the find_route function should only return intermediate hops and not the final node or intro node. Suggestions are made for a better name for the function and the possibility of passing a new struct into the send_onion_message function to consolidate the parameters. The author asks for feedback on these suggestions.\n12. Another discussion revolves around the naming of the a find_route function and a suggestion is made to use find_hops instead. The author mentions that it sounds like a task for a brewery.\n13. Possible alternatives to the find_route function name are discussed, such as get_intermediate_hops or find_path. Feedback is sought on these suggestions.\n14. The author asks if the suggested changes will make bindings difficult for @TheBlueMatt and is told that it shouldn't cause any problems.\n15. Offline discussions have taken place and it has been decided to rename the function to find_path and to change the parameters in the send_custom_message function. @TheBlueMatt is asked if he is okay with this change and if it will cause any difficulties for bindings.\n16. Another discussion takes place regarding naming and the concern of having two items with the same name in different modules. It is decided that the ChannelManager implementation will not be renamed to maintain consistency.\n17. A question is raised about the &amp;* in the code and the need for the Sized restriction. The author asks for an explanation of these concepts.\n18. An explanation is given that &amp;* is used to dereference the value and to satisfy the Sized trait, which requires a known size at compile time. The author suggests passing a logger to the Readable and ReadableArgs implementations to avoid the Sized restriction.\n19. A discussion ensues about the need for the Sized restriction and the use of the &amp;* notation. It is mentioned that the Sized trait is not required in this context.\n20. The author suggests using the deref() method instead of &amp;* and removing the Sized restriction. The code is refactored accordingly.\n21. The code is changed to remove the Sized restriction and it is confirmed that it compiles successfully.\n22. The code is reviewed and checked for errors and implmentation issues.

      "summaryeli15": "In this pull request, several changes are being made to add support for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages and replying to onion messages. The main goal is to implement the OffersMessageHandler for ChannelManager, which allows users to handle Offers messages either by providing their own custom implementation or by using the implementation provided by LDK (Lightning Development Kit) that uses stateless verification.\n\nThe changes in this pull request include:\n\n1. Adding new types and an error type to the OnionMessageContents struct: The new types include the OffersMessage struct, which represents a BOLT 12 Offers message, and the InvoiceError struct, which represents an error that can occur when handling an Invoice message. These types are used to parse and encode the messages.\n\n2. Adding a trait for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages: The OnionMessenger trait is extended to include a new method called handle_custom_message, which is responsible for handling Offers messages. The ChannelManager struct implements this trait to handle the Offers messages. This allows users to customize the behavior of the Offers message handling.\n\n3. Implementing the OnionMessageHandler trait for ChannelManager: The OnionMessenger struct is parameterized with a type that implements the OffersMessageHandler trait, which defines the behavior for handling Offers messages. The ChannelManager struct implements this trait to handle the Offers messages. This allows users to handle the Offers messages using the ChannelManager's internal logic.\n\n4. Adding a trait for finding routes for onion messages: The OnionMessenger struct is parameterized with a type that implements the MessageRouter trait, which is responsible for finding routes for onion messages. This allows the OnionMessenger to reply to messages that it handles, using the routing information provided by the MessageRouter. The OnionMessenger's send_onion_message method is modified to take an additional parameter of the MessageRouter type.\n\n5. Modifying the onion message handlers to return an optional response message: The handle_custom_message method now returns an Option<OnionMessage>, which represents the response message that the OnionMessenger will send back as a reply. This allows the handlers to choose whether they want to reply to the message or not. If a response message is returned, the OnionMessenger will send it back using the send_onion_message method.\n\n6. Making other minor changes and improvements: The code has been reviewed and improved, including making naming changes, clarifying comments, and addressing potential issues.\n\nOverall, this pull request adds the necessary support for handling BOLT 12 Offers messages and replying to onion messages. It introduces new types, traits, and methods to enable this functionality and provides options for users to customize the handling of Offers messages.",

It appears that the project involves reading feedback and taking input seriously. It also mentions the availability of qualifiers and documentation.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions the need for a GitHub account to open an issue and contact maintainers and the community. There is also a reminder to install the GitHub App Integration for organizations to avoid degraded service.\n\nThe next part of the paragraph mentions a patch coverage of 90.61% and a project coverage change of +0.15, which is considered a positive outcome. There is a comparison between a base version and a head version.\n\nAnother note mentions that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration and may experience degraded service starting on May 15th. It advises installing the integration.\n\nThe paragraph continues with a comment about removing phantom support and breaking compatibility for current users. There is a mention of a release note and seeking thoughts on handling compatibility.\n\nThe next comment raises a concern about reporting inaccurately skimmed fees when the counterparty overshoots the amount in the onion. It acknowledges that this may not happen often, but it's worth noting.\n\nAnother comment wonders if it is possible to detect when a non-penultimate intermediate node takes less fee than intended by the sender. It suggests that the available information might not be sufficient to detect this.\n\nThe following comment suggests a possible solution to calculate the skimmed fee accurately by adding it to certain functions and using the information when calculating. It acknowledges that this addition may be a separate task.\n\nNext, a comment mentions the possibility of using the skimmed fee to determine if the destination node is an LSP Client. It suggests shortening the payment by 1 msat to check if it fails, indicating that it is an LSP client.\n\nAnother comment acknowledges a catch and mentions fixing it. It also suggests exposing the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field via PaymentClaimed.\n\nThis comment repeats the previous one.\n\nA new comment raises the concern that an intermediary node can cause a payment to fail by not taking enough fee. It suggests using the counterparty_skimmed_fee_msat field to check if the destination node is an LSP Client.\n\nThe next comment mentions that a previous issue has been fixed and apologizes for the misunderstanding.\n\nAnother comment suggests that the resulting amount should be None if there is nothing to subtract. It also raises the question of whether the process should fail if the resulting amount is zero.\n\nThe next comment mentions rebasing on another pull request to address potential conflicts.\n\nOne comment states that the changes look good with a small remark and nitpick.\n\nAnother comment repeats the previous one.\n\nA comment raises a question about a potential attack and suggests that the current implementation may still be vulnerable to it. It notes that the current documentation only checks the amount_msat.\n\nThe following comment clarifies that the fee skimmed being too high indicates that a prior node took too much. It dismisses the idea that intermediate nodes can affect the final skimmed fee.\n\nThe next comment acknowledges a mistake and apologizes for the confusion.\n\nFinally, a comment suggests supporting the ability to set certain values as a follow-up task and mentions the use case of being the first payment to a specific client. There is also a mention of the possibility of sending a payment to an intercept SCID.",
      "summaryeli15": "This comment is discussing a proposed change in a software project. The project is related to Lightning Network, a protocol for conducting fast and scalable transactions on top of blockchain technology. The change being discussed is the addition of support for skimming an additional fee from intercepted HTLCs.\n\nHTLC stands for Hashed Time-Locked Contract, which is a mechanism used in Lightning Network to ensure secure and atomic transactions. Intercepting HTLCs means that an intermediary node in the network receives and handles a transaction before forwarding it to the next node.\n\nThe proposed change aims to allow the forwarder (the node that intercepts the HTLC) to skim an additional fee from the transaction. This additional fee would be deducted from the amount being forwarded. The purpose of this change is to give the forwarder the ability to extract some compensation for their role in facilitating the transaction.\n\nThe comment also mentions the patch coverage and project coverage changes, indicating the percentage of code that is covered by the change and the improvement in coverage achieved. This is measured to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the changes.\n\nThe comment further mentions that the organization is not using the GitHub App Integration, which may result in degraded service. The user is advised to install the GitHub App Integration for better service.\n\nThe comment then discusses some specific points related to the proposed change. The author of the comment mentions that they have removed support for a feature called \"phantom\" for now. They also note that this change may break compatibility for current users of a particular configuration. However, they are unsure if a release note would be sufficient to address this compatibility issue.\n\nThe author also raises a concern about the accuracy of reporting the skimmed fee in cases where the counterparty (the node that receives the forwarded transaction) exceeds the amount specified in the transaction. They note that this could result in inaccurately reporting the skimmed fee. They acknowledge that this scenario may not occur frequently and the offset may not be significant, but they wanted to bring it to attention.\n\nIn response to another comment, the author acknowledges that the reported field for the skimmed fee may be inaccurate if an intermediate node in the network takes a lower fee than intended by the sender. They mention that there may not be a way to detect this issue, as they only have information about the intended total amount and the actual received total, and they may be missing something in their understanding.\n\nThe author suggests a possible solution where the skimmed fee is added to a specific method called `PendingHTLCRouting::Receive/ReceiveKeysend` and is kept track of using a certain data structure called `ClaimableHTLC`. They express uncertainty about whether it's worth incorporating this solution in the current proposed change or if it should be considered for a future follow-up.\n\nAnother comment discusses the possibility of an intermediary node not taking enough fee, which could cause a payment to fail. The author mentions that this may not be a major issue but suggests that it could be used to determine if the destination node is a specific type of node (LSP Client) or just a normal routing node. They propose intentionally shortening the payment by a very small amount and observing if the payment fails, as an indicator of the type of node.\n\nIn response to a comment about exposing the skimmed fee field in a specific event called `PaymentClaimed`, the author agrees that it would be nice to have this field exposed in that event as well.\n\nAnother comment suggests updating the field name in the code to make it clear that it represents the fee skimmed by the counterparty. The author agrees with this suggestion and makes the necessary changes.\n\nOne of the comments mistakenly raises a concern about the final skimmed fee being affected by intermediate nodes, but then realizes that the issue has already been addressed and corrects their mistake.\n\nIn response to another comment, the author suggests that a follow-up change could be made to allow the setting of the skimmed fee. This change would be useful for a specific use case where a particular type of node (LSP) wants to be the first payment to a given client and needs to take a fee on the first hop.\n\nThe author also mentions that they have rebased their work on another pull request to resolve any conflicts in advance.\n\nFinally, a comment approves the proposed change with some suggestions for improvement. They mention that there is one actual comment (probably a code review comment) and a minor issue that can be fixed. They suggest squashing (combining) the commits to clean up the code history.",

It states that the musig2 session logic has been refactored into a new package and struct. This allows for reusability in tests without creating the entire wallet system. Additionally, some preparations have been made to update the chanfunding package for the new musig2 channels.\n\nThe comment further explains that a counter-based system is used to generate the nonces sent to the remote party in the local session. The commitment height is used as the underlying counter, and the existing shachain producer generates fresh but deterministic randomness based on this counter. This eliminates the need to store the secret nonce on disk. Instead, the nonce is regenerated when needed and combined with the stored signature to create the final witness for broadcasting.\n\nThe comment also mentions that the next PR in this series will use the changes made in this PR and its dependents to implement the funding logic within the wallet itself.\n\nSome of the subsequent comments seem to be review comments, discussing details of specific commits and suggesting changes or improvements. It appears that there is a discussion about enforcing a check to ensure that the nonce is not repeated and making sure that the opts is always set for m.commitType == localCommit.\n\nThere is also a mention of unit tests missing and an offer to help with them.

Let's go through each commit in detail:\n\nCommit 1:\nIn this commit, the musig2 session logic is refactored into a new package and struct. This refactoring allows for the reusability of the musig2 session logic in tests without having to create the entire wallet system.\n\nCommit 2:\nIn this commit, some preparations are made to update the chanfunding package to support the new musig2 channels.\n\nCommit 3:\nIn this commit, a counter-based system is implemented to generate the nonces that are sent to the remote party in the local session. The commitment height is used as the underlying counter, and it is used by the existing shachain producer to generate fresh, deterministic randomness. This approach eliminates the need to store the secret nonce to disk. Instead, the nonce can be regenerated using the commitment height, and the sig obtained from disk can be combined with it to create the final witness for broadcasting.\n\nCommit 4:\nThis commit is not explicitly described in the message provided.\n\nCommit 5:\nIn this commit, the musig2 session management is extracted into its own module, allowing for its reuse in unit tests without having to instantiate the entire wallet.\n\nCommit 6:\nIn this commit, the set of intents and assemblers are updated to recognize musig2. A new boolean variable, `musig2`, is introduced to determine whether the new taproot funding scripts need to be used.\n\nCommit 7:\nIn this commit, a series of abstractions is added to facilitate funding and state updates for the new taproot channels. The concept of a partial session is introduced, which is defined by the knowledge of a verification nonce. Once the remote party sends a signature, we learn of their signing nonce and can complete the session. A JIT (Just-In-Time) nonce approach is used to ensure that the signer can generate their nonces randomly and at the last step to avoid the need to maintain additional state. For the local nonces, a counter-based nonce derived from the shachain is introduced as an option, eliminating the need for storing additional state. Instead, when broadcasting is required, the nonce can be regenerated and used for the broadcast.\n\nCommit 8:\nIn this commit, the old `HashMutex` struct is removed to eliminate code duplication. The main Mutex struct now takes a type parameter, allowing the key to be parameterized when instantiating the struct.\n\nCommit 9:\nThis commit introduces the multimutex. Instead of relying on a single mutex for the entire musig session set, the multimutex uses the session ID as a key to access a map of mutexes and provides a more efficient and scalable solution.\n\nOverall, these commits introduce various improvements and enhancements related to the musig2 session logic and taproot channels. Some code duplication is eliminated, and the overall code structure is optimized for better performance and reusability.",

The developers have made some changes and improvements along the way, including refactoring the code to unify signing and verifying incoming commitment transaction signatures.\n\nOne important aspect of this PR is the use of nonces. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic algorithms, and in this case, it is sent in the open_channel message by the funder. The nonce can be used to generate the final signature when receiving the funding_signed.nonce from the fundee.\n\nTo derive the local nonce, the developers use an existing functional option type based on the initial shachain pre-image, which is used as the revocation. This allows them to generate nonces that can always be arrived at again using a counter-based method.\n\nThe PR also includes the integration of the new funding flow into the existing internal wallet integration tests. This ensures that the changes made do not break any existing functionality.\n\nThe last ~14 commits in this PR are new, and some rebase issues were found and fixed in commits marked as [temp]. These changes were likely made to address any conflicts or issues that arose during the development process.\n\nThe next PR in this series will focus on modifying the channel state machine to understand the new commitment dance.

      "summaryeli15": "In this pull request (PR), the developers are making several changes to integrate taproot channels into the existing internal funding flow of the project. They also make some improvements and refactorings, such as unifying the signing and verifying process for incoming commitment transaction signatures.\n\nTo explain some specific details in this PR, let's start with the concept of a \"nonce.\" In the context of this PR, a nonce is a value that is used as part of a cryptographic protocol to ensure security and prevent replay attacks. In the case of taproot channels, the nonce is sent by the funder (the party providing the funding) in the \"open_channel\" message. It can be used by the fundee (the party receiving the funding) to generate the final signature when receiving the \"funding_signed.nonce\" message from the funder.\n\nThe developers use an existing functional option type to derive the nonce based on an initial \"shachain pre-image\" that they will use for revocation. This means they use a specific method or function that takes the pre-image (a piece of data used in cryptographic protocols) as an input and derives the nonce value from it.\n\nAdditionally, the developers connect the new funding flow with the existing internal wallet integration tests. This means they make sure that the changes they made for the taproot channels are compatible with the existing tests for the wallet functionality.\n\nIt's important to note that the last ~14 commits in this PR are new additions. During the process, the developers encountered some issues related to rebasing (the process of integrating changes from one branch into another) and fixed them in commits marked as [temp]. These commits indicate that the changes are only temporary and will likely be modified or removed in later commits.\n\nThe next PR in this series will focus on modifying the channel state machine to understand the new commitment dance. This suggests that the developers will further refine or extend the functionality related to commitments in the following PR.\n\nThe PR mentions documentation and guidelines that provide further guidance on contributing to the project. This signifies that there are specific guidelines or instructions that contributors should follow when making changes to the project.\n\nIf anyone has questions or concerns about this project, they can sign up for a free GitHub account and open an issue to contact the maintainers and the community.

The solution is a workaround for persisting TLV data transmitted in \"update_add_hltc\". When extra data needs to be saved, the TLVs are encoded, and the channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData field is set according to the provided PaymentDescriptor.\n\nThe passage explains that by clicking \"Sign up for GitHub,\" the person agrees to the terms of service and privacy statement.

It notes that migrating in this area can be avoided by following this approach.\n\nThe next part suggests that before proceeding, a manual review should be done to ensure there are no other areas where an exact length is used instead of being serialized as variable bytes. This review would be posted separately for feedback.\n\nThe passage continues with further explanations and code-related details, including how the HTLCs are serialized, deserialized, stored, and loaded into memory.

It also indicates that a requested review is awaited from the user \"ellemouton\" and that successfully merging the PR may close some issues. The last part explains the motivation behind the changes, which is to extend HLTCs with additional data by utilizing the known length and variable length in byte encoding.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! Here's a detailed explanation:\n\nThis project involves making changes to the way TLV (Type-Length-Value) data is persisted in the channeldb's HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) struct in the lightning network.\n\nCurrently, onion blobs in lightning are exactly 1366 bytes in size. However, they are stored as a byte slice in the HTLC struct in the channeldb. The blobs are serialized as variable bytes, meaning that their length can vary.\n\nThe goal of this project is to take advantage of the variable byte encoding for the blob field and use it to add additional data to the serialization of HTLCs. This allows us to extend the HTLCs with additional information without the need to create a new database bucket.\n\nTo achieve this, we utilize the TLV encoding technique. TLV is a method of encoding data that includes a type, length, and value. In this case, the type represents the additional data we want to store, the length represents the number of bytes in the data, and the value represents the actual data.\n\nThe approach taken in this project is to encode the TLVs and set the channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData field to store the encoded TLVs. This allows us to save the extra data in the HTLC struct.\n\nThe PR (Pull Request) demonstrates a workaround for persisting TLV data transmitted in update_add_hltc. It provides an example of where the channeldb.HTLC.ExtraData field needs to be set.\n\nThe PR also mentions the need to ensure that there are no other areas in the codebase where an exact length is used instead of variable bytes serialization. This is important to ensure consistency and to avoid potential issues.\n\nIn addition, the PR mentions the possibility of combining this solution with a larger preparatory route blinding PR, but it is mentioned that keeping the DB workaround PRs isolated is also a valid approach.\n\nThe PR includes changes to the functions responsible for serializing and deserializing HTLCs to include the updated logic for TLV encoding and decoding. The HTLCs are serialized and deserialized using the updated functions as part of commitSet.\n\nLegacy nodes in the codebase that used LogChainActions/FetchChainActions are also mentioned. These nodes also serialize and deserialize using variable bytes.\n\nOverall, the PR is seen as a good solution that gets the job done and allows for the addition of extra data to HTLCs while avoiding the need for migrations in the codebase.\n\nThere are a few comments left on the PR that address minor issues and provide suggestions for improvement. The comments are mainly nits and suggestions for further improvement.\n\nThe project is generally well-received, and the changes are seen as clear and well-implemented. Once the minor issues are addressed, the PR is considered ready to be merged.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

      "summaryeli15": "Blockstream Greenlight is a platform that allows you to run your own Lightning node in the cloud. This node can be used to interact with the Lightning Network and manage your Bitcoin transactions. Greenlight provides a number of services that can be accessed through grpc, allowing applications to integrate with the platform.\n\nThe platform includes a number of tools and resources to help you get started. One of these tools is the python glcli command line tool, which provides a quick walkthrough of how to set up and use Greenlight. There are prebuilt packages available for glcli and the gl-client-py library, which allow you to start using the platform without having to compile any binary extensions.\n\nDuring the registration process, the scheduler manages the process of creating your node and authenticating your application. It generates an mTLS certificate and a private key that are used to authenticate and authorize your application with the services provided by Greenlight. These credentials should be stored securely on your device and used for all future communication with the platform.\n\nIf you need to recover your node, the key manager is responsible for providing a signature to authenticate the recovery process. Similar to the registration process, this also generates a certificate and a private key that can be used to authenticate and authorize your application.\n\nOnce your node is set up, you can manage it using glcli. The node can be reached directly using the provided URI. To attach the Hardware Security Module Daemon (hsmd) to your node, you need to run a specific command. The hsmd is not required for all commands, but it is recommended to have it running in parallel with other commands for better performance.\n\nFrom this point on, you can manage your node just as you would with a local node. This includes sending and receiving Bitcoin transactions, opening and closing channels, and other operations related to the Lightning Network.\n\nWhen using the language bindings provided by Greenlight, a 32-byte secret is required. This secret is used to generate all private keys and other secrets needed for your node. It should be securely generated and stored on your device. It should never be stored on the application server, as it controls your funds. It is recommended to generate the seed secret according to the BIP 39 standard for portability and security.\n\nGreenlight currently supports three networks: bitcoin, testnet, and regtest. It is suggested to mostly use testnet for testing purposes. The platform plans to add support for signet in the future. It is important to note that the testnet can sometimes be unreliable, and the lightning network running on testnet may not be well-maintained.\n\nCurrently, the platform consists of a single cluster in the us-west2 region. There are plans to implement geo-load-balancing of the nodes and databases to reduce roundtrip times from other regions. The roundtrip times can be relatively high for more distant regions, and the mTLS handshake requires multiple roundtrips. This will be improved in future updates with the roll-out of geo-load-balancing.\n\nTo minimize the overhead of the mTLS handshake, it is recommended to keep the grpc connections open and reuse them whenever possible.\n\nTo install gl-cli and gl-client-py, you can use pip with the following commands:\n```\npip install -U gl-client\npip install --extra-index-url=https://us-west2-python.pkg.dev/c-lightning/greenlight-pypi/simple/ -U glcli\n```\n\nThe documentation provides more detailed information about the available commands and their usage.",

      "summary": "The passage is discussing the development of a project called @lnp2pbot, a Telegram bot that allows people to buy and sell Bitcoin through the Lightning Network without funds custody and without KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. The project aims to provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial peer-to-peer exchange platform. However, there are concerns about relying solely on Telegram, as it may be subject to government interference.\n\nTo address these concerns, the project introduces a platform called Nostr. Nostr is envisioned as a platform where the system can function without the possibility of being censored by a powerful entity. The document outlines the implementation of a peer-to-peer exchange platform using Nostr and introduces a component called Mostro.\n\nMostro acts as an escrow, facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers on the platform. It utilizes a Lightning Network node to handle Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network node creates hold invoices for sellers and receives lightning regular invoices from buyers. Mostro requires a private key to create, sign, and send events through the Nostr network.\n\nTo enable the platform, the project is creating a Mostro client in Rust. Buyers and sellers will need to use Mostro's clients and a Lightning Wallet. Currently, a web client is being developed, with plans for mobile and desktop clients in the future.\n\nThe document emphasizes the importance of making it easy for anyone to become a Mostro. However, being a Mostro entails certain responsibilities and requirements. A Mostro admin needs to have a Lightning Network node running with sufficient liquidity for fast operations and high uptime to ensure reliability. To cover the resources required, sellers would pay a fee on each successful order, with the percentage varying between Mostros.\n\nUsers on the platform will have the ability to rate Mostros, which will create competition among Mostros to attract more users. Bad Mostros that receive negative ratings will be rejected by users and lose incentives to continue operating.\n\nThe document also provides instructions for compiling the project on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, including installing necessary dependencies, cloning the repository, creating a settings file, and initializing the database. Additionally, it mentions a private dockerized relay option for running the project.\n\nIn summary, the document presents the development of a peer-to-peer exchange platform called Mostro, which aims to provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial solution for buying and selling Bitcoin through the Lightning Network on the Nostr platform.",
      "summaryeli15": "In 2021, a project called @lnp2pbot was started on Telegram to allow people to buy and sell Bitcoin through the Lightning Network without requiring personal data or KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This project has gained popularity worldwide, particularly in Latin America, where people are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as an alternative form of currency in dictatorial regimes like Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nWhile the @lnp2pbot works well on Telegram, there is a concern that it may be susceptible to censorship or interference from powerful governments. In response to this, the Nostr platform has emerged as a solution where a system like @lnp2pbot can operate without the risk of being censored by a powerful entity.\n\nNostr provides a censorship-resistant and non-custodial Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange platform. To facilitate this exchange, a platform called Mostro has been developed. Mostro acts as an escrow service, reducing the risk for both buyers and sellers.\n\nTo handle Bitcoin transactions, Mostro utilizes a Lightning Network node. The node creates hold invoices for sellers and pays buyers using Lightning regular invoices. Mostro requires a private key to create, sign, and send events through the Nostr network.\n\nThe goal is to make it easy for anyone to become a Mostro participant. While multiple Mostros are not necessary, it is important for the existing ones to be reliable. Therefore, the implementation encourages users to create their own Mostro instances, which will provide more options for users. However, running a Mostro requires significant resources, including a lightning node that is consistently operational with high uptime.\n\nBuyers and sellers will need Mostro's clients, as well as a Lightning Wallet, to participate in Bitcoin buying and selling. Initially, a web client will be built, with plans to develop mobile and desktop clients in the future.\n\nTo support and maintain Mostro instances, it is necessary for Mostro admins to have a lightning node up and running with sufficient liquidity for fast transactions. The node's uptime should be close to 99.9%. To cover the costs of resources, sellers pay a fee on each successful order, which can vary between Mostros.\n\nUsers will have the ability to rate and provide feedback on Mostros. Mostros will compete to obtain more users to survive and thrive. Poorly rated Mostros will be rejected by users and will lose the incentives to continue existing.\n\nTo compile the Mostro code on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS, you need to install cargo and run specific commands mentioned in the documentation. It is important to set the correct variables in the settings.dev.toml file to connect with an LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node.\n\nThe Mostro data is saved in a SQLite database file named mostro.db by default, which can be changed by editing the settings.dev.toml file. Before building the code, it is necessary to initialize the database using sqlx_cli.\n\nTo run Mostro with a private dockerized relay, specific steps are provided in the documentation.\n\nOverall, the Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange platform on Nostr, powered by the Mostro platform, aims to provide a censorship-resistant and non-custodial solution for buying and selling Bitcoin through the Lightning Network. It promotes easy accessibility for users, reliability of Mostros, and competition among them to offer the best service.",

      "summary": "The passage describes Munstr, which is a combination of Schnorr signature-based MuSig (multisignature) keys and decentralized Nostr networks. Munstr aims to provide a secure and encrypted method for transporting and digitally signing bitcoin transactions while keeping the transaction data's nature and setup hidden from chain analysis.\n\nTo achieve this, Munstr utilizes a terminal-based wallet that supports interactive, multi-signature (n-of-n) functionality. This wallet allows a group of signers to coordinate an interactive signing session for taproot-based outputs, which are associated with an aggregated public key.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Munstr is currently in beta and shouldn't be used with real funds. The code and authors are subject to change, and the maintainers take no responsibility for any lost funds or damages.\n\nSome key features of Munstr include:\n\n1. Open source: The software is open source, meaning anyone can use it or contribute to its development.\n\n2. Multisignature keysets: Munstr utilizes multisignature keysets to reduce the risk associated with a single key. This increases the overall security of the wallet.\n\n3. Encrypted communications: Munstr leverages Nostr decentralized events for encrypted communications. The Nostr network acts as a transport and communications layer for partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) data.\n\nThe flow of Munstr involves the following components:\n\n1. Signer: The signer is responsible for digitally signing a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) using the private keys in a multisignature keyset.\n\n2. Nostr network: The Nostr decentralized network serves as a transport and communications layer for PSBT data. It enables secure transmission of the signed transaction data.\n\n3. Coordinators: Coordinators act as mediators between digital signers and wallets. They assist in facilitating digital signatures from each required (n-of-n) key signer and help with broadcasting the fully signed transaction.\n\nIn addition to the libraries specified in the requirements.txt file, Munstr also uses other resources (not mentioned specifically in the passage).\n\nLastly, it mentions that Munstr is licensed under the MIT License, with copyright held by TeamMunstr. The provided command \"cp src/coordinator/db.template.json src/coordinator/db.json ./start_coordinator.py\" seems to be related to setting up the coordinator's database file.\n\nOverall, Munstr is a project that aims to provide a secure and private way of conducting bitcoin transactions using multisignature keys and encrypted communications.",
      "summaryeli15": "Munstr is a software that combines different technologies to provide a secure and private way of conducting bitcoin transactions. It uses Schnorr signature-based MuSig (multisignature) keys and the Nostr decentralized network as communication infrastructure.\n\nTo understand how Munstr works, let's break it down:\n\n1. Schnorr Signature-based MuSig: This is a cryptographic signature scheme that allows multiple individuals, or signers, to collectively create a single signature for a bitcoin transaction. It uses multisignature keys, which are a set of private keys owned by different participants. By combining their private keys, the signers can generate a unique signature that represents their joint authorization for a transaction.\n\n2. Nostr decentralized network: Nostr is a decentralized network that provides a secure and encrypted communication layer for Munstr. It ensures that the transaction data and coordination between signers remain private and cannot be identified through blockchain analysis. The network acts as a transport layer for the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) data, which contains the necessary information for signing the transaction.\n\n3. Terminal-based wallet: Munstr operates through a terminal-based wallet interface, allowing users to interact with the software through command-line commands. This wallet enables signers to coordinate an interactive signing session for Taproot-based outputs, which are a type of bitcoin transaction that improves privacy and scalability.\n\n4. Nature of Munstr transactions: Munstr transactions are designed to appear as single key Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) spends when observed on the blockchain. This means that to an external observer, a Munstr transaction will look like a regular transaction involving a single key, making it difficult to determine the full nature and setup of the transaction data.\n\nIt's important to note that Munstr is still in beta stage, which means it's not yet suitable for managing real funds. The software is open-source, meaning anyone can use it or contribute to its development. Multisignature keysets are used to reduce the risk associated with a single private key being compromised. Encrypted communications through the Nostr network further enhance the security and privacy of the transaction process.\n\nTo use Munstr, a signer must possess private keys belonging to a multisignature keyset. They use these keys to digitally sign a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT). The PSBT data is then transmitted through the Nostr decentralized network. Coordinators act as intermediaries between the signers and wallets, facilitating the collection of digital signatures from all required key signers. Once all signatures are collected, the coordinator assists in broadcasting the fully signed transaction to the Bitcoin network.\n\nMunstr also utilizes other libraries and technologies listed in the requirements.txt file. The software is licensed under the MIT License and maintained by TeamMunstr. It's important to acknowledge that the project and its authors might change over time, and the maintainers do not take responsibility for any financial losses or damages that may occur while using Munstr.",

      "summary": "In this passage, the focus is on the \"Proof of Liabilities\" (PoL) part of a problem related to an ecash system. The PoR (Proof of Reserves) part is assumed to be already solved using conventional on-chain attestation methods.\n\nThe passage describes how a person named Carol can withdraw funds from their Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment using ecash. To do this, Carol sends the ecash to the mint and asks the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value. The mint then burns the ecash, which means it destroys the tokens, and pays the invoice.\n\nOne important aspect to note is that ecash tokens have a relatively short lifetime because they are burned, or destroyed, at every transaction and at any payout onto Lightning. As a result, the list of issued signatures and the list of burned tokens can grow quickly and indefinitely if not managed properly.\n\nTo address this issue, the passage introduces the concept of key rotation as a solution. Key rotation involves changing the cryptographic keys used by the mint in an agreed-upon schedule. The mint publishes publicly released PoL reports that include all mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and burn proofs (redeemed secrets). These reports can be used to verify the mint's liabilities and reserves.\n\nFigure (a) in the passage illustrates that a cheating mint would try to manipulate the PoL reports by artificially shortening the list of mint proofs and inflating the list of burn proofs. However, a cheating mint cannot manipulate its on-chain assets, which are part of the PoR report.\n\nFigure (b) shows that a mint's PoL, which represents its outstanding ecash balance, is compared to its PoR, which represents its on-chain assets. If a mint tries to artificially reduce its open balance in the PoL report, it can be caught because it cannot inflate its on-chain assets in the PoR report.\n\nUsers play an important role in verifying the PoL reports. They check if an old mint proof list was manipulated after key rotation and ensure that all their blind signatures are included in the report. They also verify if their ecash from an old epoch is worth more than the outstanding balance of that epoch.\n\nIf a user finds that their blind signature is missing from the PoL reports, they can contest the report by providing a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof. This DLEQ proof allows others to verify that the contested signature is indeed from the mint. However, revealing the DLEQ proof removes the privacy and unlinkability of the specific ecash token involved in the contest.\n\nAnother way a mint could lie about its PoL report is by including fake burn proofs in its list of spent secrets. This means the mint could create unbacked ecash, spend it, and then report those spends as burn proofs. By doing this, the mint can increase the amount of redeemed ecash and decrease the reported outstanding balance.\n\nTo prevent such fraudulent behavior, the keys used by the mint are rotated periodically. This rotation ensures that the mint commits to not add any additional fake mint proofs to its past PoL reports. User wallets adopt a policy of refusing tokens from epochs other than the most recent one.\n\nKey rotation introduces an \"arrow of time\" to the token dynamics, enforced by the users themselves. Tokens from old epochs are forced to move into the newest keyset, simulating a periodic \"bank run.\" This allows users to observe past epochs and determine if the mint has manipulated the reports.\n\nIn summary, the proposed PoL scheme relies on verifying the mint's liabilities through publicly released reports. Users play an important role in detecting any manipulation or fraudulent behavior by the mint. By using key rotation and enforcing policies on token acceptance, the scheme aims to provide a trust model with multisig control over the majority of the mint's funds and efficient payment operation.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe problem being addressed here is how to ensure the trustworthiness and auditability of an ecash system. The focus is on the Proof of Liabilities (PoL) aspect, assuming that the Proof of Reserves (PoR) part is already solved using conventional on-chain attestation methods.\n\nIn this system, when a user (let's call her Carol) wants to withdraw her funds onto her Lightning wallet or make a Lightning payment to someone else, she sends the ecash to the mint and asks the mint to pay a Lightning invoice of the same value. The mint then burns the ecash, which means the ecash is destroyed, and pays the invoice.\n\nNow, since ecash is burned at every transaction and at any payout onto Lightning, the lifetime of an ecash token is relatively short. This also means that both the list of issued signatures (mint proofs) and the list of burned tokens (burn proofs) can grow quickly and indefinitely if there is no mechanism to handle them. To solve this problem, a key rotation mechanism is introduced.\n\nKey rotation works by periodically changing the keys used by the mint. This simple solution helps in managing the growth of the lists. Here's how it works in the Proof of Liabilities (PoL) scheme:\n\n1. Publicly released PoL reports: The mint releases PoL reports publicly, which include all mint proofs (issued blind signatures) and all burn proofs (redeemed secrets). A cheating mint would try to artificially shorten the list of mint proofs and inflate the list of burn proofs.\n\n2. Comparing PoL to PoR: The mint's proof-of-liabilities (outstanding ecash balance) is compared to its proof-of-reserves (on-chain assets). A cheating mint would try to artificially reduce the open balance, but it can't inflate its on-chain assets.\n\n3. Verifying old mint proof lists: Users verify whether an old mint proof list was manipulated after key rotation and whether all their blind signatures are included in the report. Users also verify whether their ecash from an old epoch is worth more than the outstanding balance of that epoch.\n\n4. Catching cheating mints: If users find that their blind signature is not listed in the PoL reports, they can publicly prove that they obtained a blind signature from the mint. The user contesting the report provides a discrete-log equality (DLEQ) proof, which others can use to verify the signature is indeed from the mint. Revealing the DLEQ proof removes the privacy of the contesting user but alerts others to the potential cheating by the mint.\n\n5. Detection of fake burn proofs: A mint could lie about its PoL report by including fake burn proofs in its list of spent secrets. This means the mint could spend unbacked ecash from a wallet it controls and report it as burned. Users can detect this if they have a token that was not accounted for in the burn proof report. This triggers suspicion for all other users and tilts the cost-benefit balance towards catching the fraudulent mint.\n\n6. Key rotation and enforcing trust: By rotating the mint's keys on an agreed-upon schedule, the mint publicly commits to not adding any additional fake mint proofs to their past PoL reports. User wallets, on the other hand, adopt a policy to refuse tokens from epochs other than the most recent one. With these rules in place, rotating the keys has two main effects: it introduces an \"arrow of time\" onto the token dynamics and simulates a periodic \"bank run\" that allows users to observe past epochs and determine whether the mint has manipulated the reports.\n\nIn summary, the Proof of Liabilities (PoL) scheme aims to provide trust and auditability in an ecash system. Key rotation is used to manage the growth of mint and burn proof lists, and users can detect any cheating attempts by the mint through the verification of old mint proof lists and the detection of fake burn proofs. The scheme relies on the agreement between users and the mint, as well as the periodic rotation of keys to enforce trust in the system.",

It is built using LDK and BDK, and provides a straightforward interface and an integrated on-chain wallet. This library, developers can quickly and easily set up a Lightning node within a day.\n\nLDK Node is designed to provide sane defaults for users, but to effectively set up all interconnected modules, users need to have a deeper understanding of the protocol fundamentals and some familiarity with the LDK API. Additionally, LDK Node is wallet-agnostic, which means it does not come with an included on-chain wallet. Users are responsible for integrating it with a suitable on-chain wallet.\n\nGetting started with LDK can require some effort, which is why LDK Node was created as a more fully-baked solution. It hides the complexities of the protocol while maintaining usability. Compared to LDK's extensive API surface with over 900 exposed methods, LDK Node's API is much smaller, currently encompassing only around 30 API calls. This reduced complexity makes it easier for users to work with.\n\nWhile LDK Node prioritizes simplicity and minimalism, it remains configurable enough to operate a fully functional self-custodial Lightning node in various use cases. There is a trade-off between simplicity and expressiveness when designing an API that handles protocol complexity. Increasing the configurability and interconnectivity of components can make the API more complicated, requiring users to spend more time examining and learning it. LDK Node leans towards simplicity while still providing an expressive API.\n\nThe first release of LDK Node includes opinionated design choices and ready-to-go modules. It aims to simplify the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. The features in the initial release are centered around mobile deployments, considering the limitations of mobile environments such as bandwidth and overall traffic quota. It integrates with an Esplora chain data source and a Rapid Gossip Sync server to enable mobile operation.\n\nLDK Node is primarily written in Rust but offers language bindings for Swift, Kotlin, and Python based on UniFFI. This allows developers to use LDK Node in Rust programs as well as in mobile environments using Flutter.\n\nThe main abstraction provided by LDK Node is the Node object, which can be retrieved by setting up and configuring a Builder object according to your preferences and calling one of the build methods. The Node object can then be controlled using commands such as start, stop, connect_open_channel, and send_payment.\n\nThe code provided at the end of the explanation demonstrates the usage of LDK Node, including setting the network, configuring the Esplora server and Rapid Gossip Sync server, starting the node, creating a funding address, connecting to another node, handling events, sending a payment using an invoice, and stopping the node.",

Flutter bindings are available for usage in mobile environments.\n\nThe main abstraction in the LDK Node library is the Node, which can be obtained by setting up and configuring a Builder object and calling one of the build methods. The Node object can then be controlled using commands like start, stop, connect_open_channel, and send_payment.\n\nThe code example provided shows how to use LDK Node in a Rust program. It sets up a Builder object, configures the network, Esplora server, and Gossip Sync server. It then builds a Node object, starts it, creates a new on-chain address, connects to another Lightning node, waits for an event, handles the event, sends a payment using an invoice, and finally stops the Node.",

      "summary": "The passage discusses a project called BTC Warp, which aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network more efficiently. Currently, syncing a full Bitcoin node can take several days due to the large number of blocks and transactions that need to be downloaded. This process is time-consuming, energy-consuming, and requires significant hardware and network requirements.\n\nBTC Warp utilizes zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to provide a succinct, verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers. Light nodes, which do not participate in consensus or store the full chain history, can utilize this proof to instantly sync with the Bitcoin network. The goal is to enable Bitcoin to reach massive scale by reducing the networking and hardware requirements for light clients.\n\nThere are three types of Bitcoin nodes: full nodes, which store the entire blockchain; light nodes, which only store block headers; and mining nodes, which participate in the consensus process. Light nodes have properties that make them suitable for certain use cases, such as smartphones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts, as they can connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without the need for extensive hardware and networking resources.\n\nHowever, the size of the Bitcoin chain poses a challenge for light node syncing. To address this, BTC Warp leverages zkSNARKs to generate a succinct proof of validity for a certain header with a specific amount of work associated with it. By verifying these proofs, light nodes can sync with the Bitcoin network quickly and without the need to download and validate every block header.\n\nTo overcome the limitation of the number of SHA calculations that can be included in a zkSNARK circuit, recursive SNARKs are used. This allows for parallelized proof generation, improving scalability, compute efficiency, and reducing the degree of centralization. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system is used, providing benefits such as faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, generating SNARK proofs can be computationally expensive. To address this, computation needs to be parallelized, requiring infrastructure to coordinate the generation of a proof tree. The current proof generation process takes around $5000, but optimization efforts aim to reduce the cost to approximately $1000 for a one-time sync and even less for proof updates with new blocks.\n\nBTC Warp also considers the need to prove the validity of new Bitcoin block headers. A composable tree approach is chosen, allowing for faster and cheaper initial proof generation while guaranteeing proofs for future blocks. However, there is a limitation in the construction where only blocks up to a certain point can be proven, requiring a resync of the light client when new blocks are produced.\n\nTo obtain Bitcoin block headers, the Nakamoto light client is used. The light client library is written in Rust, and Nakamoto is utilized to listen to network gossip and update the proof for new blocks. An API is created around Nakamoto to serve block headers, facilitating the proof generation step.\n\nOptimizations and benchmarking are performed to determine the most cost-effective and time-effective way to generate the proofs. Various parameters are tuned, such as the depth of the proof tree, the number of headers to prove in a sequence, and the number of proofs to generate per Fargate instance. AWS Fargate instances are used to perform the proof generation, but resource limitations are noted, leading to increased costs and potential performance issues.\n\nBTC Warp aims to address the full-state proving challenge for Bitcoin, which requires verifying the UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) in a block. Efficient data structures, such as Utreexo, are considered to reduce the storage requirements for UTXOs within the zkSNARK.\n\nIn terms of use cases, BTC Warp's zero-shot sync solution can be beneficial in scenarios where instant syncing of Bitcoin light clients is required. The passage mentions three potential use cases, but it encourages readers to propose additional ideas.\n\nFinally, the project team is looking for developers with experience in Solidity, smart contract engineering, blockchain infrastructure, and writing zkSNARK/STARK circuits to join their team. They are also interested in partnerships with blockchain ecosystems or applications that can utilize their underlying primitives.\n\nOverall, BTC Warp aims to significantly improve the efficiency and accessibility of syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network by utilizing zkSNARKs and recursive SNARKs.",
      "summaryeli15": "BTC Warp is a project that aims to solve the problem of syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network. Currently, new nodes and users need several days to sync a full Bitcoin node by downloading and verifying the entire blockchain. This process is time-consuming and requires a significant amount of energy, limiting the accessibility of Bitcoin to users with specific hardware and network requirements.\n\nThe BTC Warp project uses zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to create a verifiable proof of Bitcoin block headers. This proof allows light clients to instantly sync to the Bitcoin network without downloading and storing the full chain.\n\nLight nodes, one of the three types of Bitcoin nodes, have the ability to connect and transact on the Bitcoin network without participating in consensus or storing the full chain history. They enable participants to interact with the network without the need for extensive networking and hardware requirements. Examples of light nodes include phones, desktop wallets, and smart contracts.\n\nHowever, light nodes still require storage to store block headers, which can be around 60 MB. This amount of storage is infeasible for some users. BTC Warp aims to reduce the storage requirements for light nodes to less than 30 kB using zkSNARKs.\n\nA zkSNARK allows the generation of a proof that a certain computation has a specific output, which can be verified quickly, even if the computation itself takes a long time to run. In the context of BTC Warp, the syncing algorithm is implemented inside a zkSNARK, allowing for instant verification of the heaviest proof-of-work Bitcoin chain.\n\nThe BTC chain's size poses a challenge because a zkSNARK circuit can only fit around 10,000 SHA-256 hashes, but the Bitcoin chain has over 780,000 blocks, resulting in approximately 1.5 million SHA-256 hashes. To address this challenge, BTC Warp utilizes recursive SNARKs, which can verify other SNARKs. The use of recursive SNARKs allows for parallelized proof generation, improving scalability, compute efficiency, and reducing centralization. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK proving system was chosen for its benefits, including faster proof generation and native verification on Ethereum.\n\nTo generate the proofs of validity for the BTC chain, recursive zkSNARKs are used. However, in addition to proving the validity of existing Bitcoin block headers, BTC Warp also aims to prove the validity of new block headers that are generated in the future. This introduces some complexity to the SNARK construction.\n\nA composable tree approach is chosen for the proof generation. This approach involves verifying block headers at the leaf layer and combining information from the children nodes at each non-leaf layer. Each layer's circuit can prove a sequence of headers, and together, they form the proof tree. However, this construction has a limitation that it can only prove up to a specific block number. To handle future blocks, dummy values are used in the tree until the desired block is reached.\n\nTo implement BTC Warp, BTC block headers are obtained using the Nakamoto light client, which is a Rust-based library. The Nakamoto library listens to network gossip to update the proof for new blocks. An API is created around Nakamoto to serve block headers. Optimization and benchmarking are performed to determine the most time and cost-effective way to generate the proofs.\n\nThe main bottleneck in BTC Warp is the size of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) in a block, which can take over 200 GB of storage. To address this, Utreexo and other efficient data structures within a zkSNARK are considered.\n\nBTC Warp also explores potential use cases where instant sync BTC can be utilized. The project is open to collaboration and is looking for developers with experience in Solidity, smart contract engineering, blockchain infrastructure, and writing zkSNARK/STARK circuits.\n\nOverall, BTC Warp aims to provide a solution for instantly syncing light nodes in the Bitcoin network using zkSNARKs and recursive SNARKs. By reducing storage requirements and improving scalability, BTC Warp can make Bitcoin more accessible to a wider range of users.",

      "summary": "This abstract discusses the differences in fees between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees that one might expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. The concept of out of band fees is explored as a potential explanation for these differences. The abstract mentions that there is evidence suggesting that the recent increase in these differences may not be as significant as some people believe, and that the evidence for increases in out of band fees may be limited.\n\nThe abstract also talks about the impact of sending transactions directly to a miner, stating that it can slow down block propagation between mining pools. This is because compact blocks do not work efficiently when intermediate nodes are unaware of a transaction. Slow propagation creates centralization pressure within the Bitcoin network. The abstract goes on to mention that this is less of a problem if the transaction is standard and pays enough fee to be included in all mempools, and that out of band payments can be used to top up the fee for faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges the argument that out of band fees should not exist, as the memory pool is meant to be an open competitive fee marketplace. However, it highlights that out of band fees continue to be popular for various reasons. These reasons include the desire for faster inclusion in blocks, negotiations between miners and users, and the potential for censorship resistance.\n\nThe abstract concludes by mentioning the launch of the website miningpool.observer, which displays a candidate block from a local instance of Bitcoin Core for every block produced by miners. This allows for analysis of the fee differences between the local Bitcoin Core node's block and the actual mined block. The abstract also mentions that Mempool.space has added a similar feature called \"Audit\" to their website.\n\nThe abstract includes several figures to illustrate the data being discussed. These figures show the differences in fees between actual blocks and block templates, the rapid increase in Bitcoin fees, and the distribution of fees by mining pool.\n\nOverall, the abstract sheds light on the fee differences between actual Bitcoin blocks and block templates, and explores the concept of out of band fees as a potential explanation for these differences. It also discusses the implications of sending transactions directly to miners and the challenges associated with block propagation. The abstract suggests that out of band fees may be inevitable and highlights the need for further work in minimizing their potential impact.",
      "summaryeli15": "This abstract is discussing the differences in fees between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees that one might expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. The abstract is exploring the concept of \"out of band fees\" as a potential explanation for these differences.\n\nTo understand this, let's start by explaining what Bitcoin blocks and fees are. Bitcoin blocks are groups of transactions that are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners are responsible for creating these blocks and verifying the transactions within them. To incentivize miners to include their transactions in a block, users can attach a fee to their transaction. The higher the fee, the more likely it is that the miner will prioritize that transaction and include it in a block.\n\nThe abstract is discussing the differences between the fees that are actually included in the blocks produced by miners and the fees that one might expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. A Bitcoin Core node is a software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, and it is commonly used by users to interact with the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe abstract introduces the concept of \"out of band fees\" as a potential explanation for these differences. Out of band fees refer to fees that are paid outside of the standard transaction fee. It suggests that these out of band fees may be causing the differences between the actual block fees and the expected block fees.\n\nOne problem with sending transactions directly to a miner is that it can slow down the propagation of blocks between mining pools. Block propagation refers to the process of spreading information about a new block across the network. When intermediate nodes don't know about a transaction because it was sent directly to a miner, it can slow down the block propagation process. This can create centralization pressure, meaning that a few powerful miners might have an advantage due to their faster block propagation. However, if the transaction is standard and pays enough fee to be included in all mempools (temporary storage for unconfirmed transactions), the out of band payment can simply be used to add an extra fee for faster inclusion.\n\nThe abstract acknowledges that out of band fees should not exist in an ideal scenario. The Bitcoin network's mempool is supposed to be an open competitive fee marketplace, where transactions with higher fees are more likely to be included in blocks. However, in practice, out of band fees may be necessary due to various reasons, such as the need for faster confirmation times or the desire to incentivize miners to include certain transactions.\n\nThe abstract concludes by mentioning that out of band fees may never be completely eliminated and that there is work to be done in terms of education, wallet development, and transaction selection policies to minimize the need for out of band fees.\n\nThe abstract also references the miningpool.observer website, which displays a candidate block from a local instance of Bitcoin Core for every block produced by miners. This allows for the analysis of the fee difference between the local node's candidate block and the actual mined block.\n\nIn conclusion, the abstract discusses the differences in fees between actual Bitcoin blocks produced by miners and the fees one might expect based on a local Bitcoin Core node. It suggests that out of band fees may be a potential explanation for these differences and acknowledges the challenges in eliminating out of band fees entirely. The abstract also references the miningpool.observer website as a tool for analyzing these fee differences.",

      "summary": "FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is a scheme for distributed key generation and multisignature schemes. It involves N parties, where each participant creates a secret polynomial. The evaluations of this polynomial are shared with other parties to create a joint polynomial, which represents the final FROST key.\n\nIn FROST, the shared secret is represented by the value of the joint polynomial at x=0, denoted as s=f(0). Each participant controls a single point on this polynomial corresponding to their participant index. The degree of the polynomials, denoted as T-1, determines the threshold T of the multisignature. This means that T points are required to interpolate the joint polynomial and compute evaluations under the joint secret.\n\nAn important aspect of FROST is that it allows T parties to interact and perform computations involving the secret f(0) without actually reconstructing this secret. This is unlike traditional secret sharing schemes, such as the Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret needs to be reconstructed.\n\nThe question is whether it is possible to change the number of signers N and the threshold T after the key generation process has been completed. Moreover, can these changes be made by a threshold number of signers, rather than requiring the consent of all N signers?\n\nSome ideas explored in the secret sharing literature can be applicable to handle these changes. For example, it is possible to convert a threshold of n (t of n) into a threshold of n-1 (t of n-1) if we trust one participant to delete their secret keyshare. This change can be made if the number of participants (n) is greater than the threshold (t).\n\nIf we cannot completely trust a participant to delete their secret keyshare, we can make the revoked secret keyshares incompatible with future multisignature participants. This can be achieved using proactive secret sharing techniques where the shares are periodically renewed without changing the secret. The idea is to make any information gained by an adversary during one time period useless for attacking the secret after the shares are renewed.\n\nIn order to change the number of signers N without redoing the entire key generation process, a new joint polynomial can be created with the same joint secret. This can be achieved by performing a key generation process with n-1 parties. Each participant uses the same first coefficient as their original key generation polynomial, while the other terms are chosen randomly. This results in a new polynomial with the same joint secret but with different points that are incompatible with the previous key shares.\n\nTo decrease the threshold, a secret of a single party can be shared with all other signers. This allows every other party to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively converts a threshold of n (t of n) into a threshold of n-1 (t-1 of n-1). If the number of signers needs to stay the same, a new secret keyshare can be issued to all other signers, effectively going from a threshold of n to a threshold of n-1.\n\nThere could be scenarios where steps need to be taken to ensure the fair exchange of the secret in more adversarial multisignature situations. However, the process of issuing new signers is slightly more involved.\n\nTo add a new party to the multisignature without redoing the entire key generation, enrollment protocols can be used. These protocols allow for repair or addition of a new participant without redoing the key generation. A threshold number of parties collaborate to evaluate the joint polynomial at the new participant index and securely share this new secret keyshare with the new participant. By summing these shared evaluations, the new participant can now participate in FROST signing. Verification of the received point on the joint polynomial can also be done if the original commitment polynomials are available.\n\nThere is also a proof of concept approach to recover a lost signer and enroll a new signer without requiring communication among all participants. This approach involves modifying the key generation process to include secret shares for potential future signers. These secret shares can be shared among all participants for redundancy. If a new signer needs to be added later, T signers can send the fragments of secret shares they hold that belong to the new index. By collecting a sufficient number of fragments, N secret shares can be reconstructed, resulting in a new signer with their own point on the joint polynomial.\n\nIncreasing the threshold seems more complex than redoing the key generation process, as it would require increasing the degree of the polynomial and ensuring the trustworthiness of all participants to delete the old joint polynomial.\n\nOverall, the FROST scheme provides flexibility in terms of adjusting the number of signers and the threshold, although some methods may require additional considerations and precautions to ensure security. The mentioned approaches are based on ideas from the secret sharing literature, but further research is needed to determine their provable security and suitability for the specific purpose of FROST.",
      "summaryeli15": "FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is a cryptographic scheme that involves multiple parties working together to generate a distributed key for secure communication. The distributed key is created using a technique called distributed key generation. \n\nIn this process, N parties each create their own secret polynomial. A polynomial is a mathematical equation with different terms. They then share the evaluations of their polynomials with the other parties. By combining these evaluations, they are able to create a joint polynomial that represents the final FROST key. The joint polynomial has a special property where the x=0 intercept, also known as the constant term, is the jointly shared secret (s=f(0)).\n\nEach participant controls a single point on this joint polynomial, which is determined by their participant index. The degree of the polynomials, denoted by T-1, determines the threshold T of the multisignature. The threshold is the minimum number of points required to compute evaluations under the joint secret and interpolate the joint polynomial. \n\nTo interpolate evaluations, T parties need to interact with each other. Importantly, they can perform this interpolation without reconstructing the secret in isolation. This is unlike Shamir Secret Sharing, where the secret needs to be reconstructed. \n\nNow, let's address the questions you raised. Can the number of signers N and the threshold T be changed after the key generation process is completed? And can these changes be made with just a threshold number of signers, instead of requiring the consent of all N signers? \n\nYes, it is possible to change the number of signers N and the threshold T after the key generation process. However, to do this, some precautions need to be taken to ensure the security of the system. \n\nIf you want to decrease the number of signers, i.e., change from t of n to t of (n-1), you need to trust one user to delete their secret keyshare. It is important to ensure that the number of remaining signers (n) is greater than the new threshold (t-1) to maintain the security threshold. \n\nOn the other hand, if you cannot reliably trust a party to delete their secret keyshare, you can render their revoked secret keyshares incompatible with future multisignature participants. This can be done using proactive secret sharing. Proactive secret sharing involves periodically renewing the shares without changing the secret, making any information gained by adversaries in one time period useless for attacking the secret after the renewal. You can explore more about proactive secret sharing on Wikipedia. \n\nTo increase the number of signers N or decrease the threshold T, additional measures need to be taken. For example, to decrease the threshold, you can share a secret of a single party with all other signers, allowing them to produce signature shares using that secret keyshare. This effectively turns a t of n into a (t-1) of (n-1). However, in order to keep N the same while changing the threshold, you need to issue a brand new secret keyshare to all the other signers. \n\nIn more adversarial scenarios, some fair exchange of the secret may be required to ensure it reaches all participants securely. It is also advised to back up individual secret keyshares. However, backups alone are not the same as issuing an additional party who has the power to contribute an independent signature share towards the threshold. Issuing new signers is slightly more involved.\n\nIn order to add a new party without redoing the key generation process, enrollment protocols can be used. Enrollment protocols allow for the repair or addition of a new party without redoing the key generation. A threshold number of parties collaborate to evaluate the joint polynomial at a new participant index and securely share this new secret keyshare with the new participant. This allows the new participant to participate in FROST signing.\n\nAnother approach to issuing new signers is by modifying the key generation process. After the initial key generation where each party evaluates their secret polynomial, parties can also evaluate secret shares from n+1 to n+k, where k is the number of extra signers you want to add. These secret shares can later be used to issue new signers. However, it's important to note that all N signers need to be available and agree to add the new signer in this case.\n\nTo securely distribute these secret shares without prematurely creating additional signers, you can use Shamir Secret Sharing. In this case, the secret shares are divided into fragments, which are then shared among the signers. To issue a new signer, T signers need to send all the fragments they hold for the index of the new signer. By recovering enough fragments, you can recreate the N secret shares and form a new signer with their own point on the joint polynomial.\n\nIncreasing the threshold is more complex and may require the group to somehow increase the degree of the polynomial. It would also require the trust of all participants to delete the old polynomial.\n\nIn summary, FROST's distributed key generation allows for the flexibility to change the number of signers and the threshold. However, precautions need to be taken to maintain security and ensure that the changes can be made securely. Different techniques, such as proactive secret sharing and enrollment protocols, can be used to accommodate these changes and add or remove signers in a secure manner.",

      "summary": "In this playground activity, we will simulate a bitcoin transaction using the testnet network. The aim is to make it appear as if multiple people are sending fake money to one bitcoin address, but in reality, it will look like just one person made the transaction.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of people who will participate in this transaction. It is important to note that using a very large number increases the chances of failure due to potential dropped connections or missed messages. Even a small number, like 5, can be challenging to execute successfully. It is advisable to be conservative with the number of participants.\n\nNext, we need a testnet bitcoin address where the fake money will be sent after the demonstration. This address will be used as the destination for all the simulated transactions.\n\nTo execute this playground activity, we will need access to the testnet network, which is a parallel network to the main bitcoin network specifically designed for testing purposes. It simulates real bitcoin transactions, but the bitcoins used have no real-world value.\n\nPlease provide the desired number of participants and the testnet bitcoin address where the fake money should be sent, and we can proceed with the explanation and demonstration.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! In this explanation, I'll break down the concept of a bitcoin transaction and how it can be manipulated to make it appear as though only one person sent the money, even though many people actually contributed.\n\nFirst, let's understand what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralized network called the blockchain. It allows users to send and receive payments without the need for a third party, such as a bank, to verify and process the transactions.\n\nWhen a bitcoin transaction occurs, it involves two main components: inputs and outputs. An input is basically a record of the previous transactions that have allocated a certain amount of bitcoin to a specific address, also known as a wallet. The output is the recipient's address, where the bitcoin is being sent.\n\nNow, in this playground scenario, we will be using the testnet, which is a separate network designed for testing purposes, ensuring that no real money is involved. This way, you can experiment with bitcoin transactions without any financial risk.\n\nTo make it appear as though only one person sent the money, we will leverage a feature of bitcoin called \"multisig.\" Multisig stands for multi-signature, which means multiple parties are required to sign off on a transaction before it can be considered valid.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n\n1. Input Selection: First, we need to select the inputs for our transaction. These inputs will be the previous transactions that contain the fake money contributed by multiple people. Each individual will have a specific amount associated with their address.\n\n2. Creating a Transaction: Once we have the inputs, we create a new transaction that includes all the inputs combined. However, we modify the transaction in a way that it appears as though only one person sent the money. To achieve this, we use a feature called \"scriptSig,\" which allows us to specify custom scripts for spending the inputs.\n\n3. Combining Contributions: We modify the scriptSig to include information from all the contributors, making it seem like a single person is sending the money. This step requires some scripting knowledge and manipulation of the transaction data.\n\n4. Broadcasting the Transaction: After the transaction is prepared, it needs to be broadcasted to the network. This essentially means sending the transaction details to other participants in the bitcoin network, so they are aware of the upcoming transaction.\n\n5. Verification and Consensus: The transaction will be confirmed and validated by the bitcoin network. The network will analyze the scriptSig and other transaction details to ensure the transaction is valid and conforms to the rules of the bitcoin protocol.\n\n6. Fake Money Arrives: Once the transaction is validated, the fake money will be transferred to the bitcoin address you specified at the beginning. This address is essentially the \"recipient\" of the transaction.\n\nIt's important to note that modifying transactions like this is a complex process and requires a deep understanding of the bitcoin protocol and scripting. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that trying this with a large number of participants increases the chances of failure, such as dropped connections or missed messages. Even with just a few participants, it can still be challenging.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the playground allows you to experiment with bitcoin transactions on the testnet. By using multisig and modifying the transaction scripts, you can make it appear as though only one person sent the money, despite multiple contributors. Just remember to be conservative with the number of participants, as larger numbers may lead to increased failure rates.",

They have confirmed the funding transaction and exchanged the \"channel_ready\" message to indicate that they are ready to use the channel. The state of their commitment transactions, which dictate the distribution of funds in the channel, is described. However, for the sake of simplicity, the funding transaction and certain outputs are ignored in the following diagrams.\n\nWhen either Alice or Bob wants to send a payment across the channel, they need to propose the inclusion of a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) to their channel peer.

If it fails, it will be re-added to Alice's output.\n\nEven if they haven't committed to HTLC A1 yet, they can continue adding more changes to the staging area. Alice can propose another HTLC, A2, to Bob, even before A1 is irrevocably committed.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers wants to ensure that the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending the \"commitment_signed\" message. When Alice sends this message to Bob, Bob will have all the required signatures to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction. Alice knows that her signature should cover the A1 and A2 HTLCs because the underlying transport is reliable and ordered, ensuring that Bob received her \"update_add_htlc\" messages for A1 and A2. Bob now has two valid commitment transactions, but he is incentivized to revoke his previous commitment transaction and move to the new state.\n\nBob sends the \"revoke_and_ack\" message in response to Alice's \"commitment_signed\" message. This revokes his previous state and acknowledges to Alice that Bob has received and committed to HTLC B1, adding it to his staging area commitment transaction. The state of the commitment transactions may appear different, but both sides know the consequences of either transaction being confirmed on-chain.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can respond to Bob's \"commitment_signed\" message with her \"revoke_and_ack\" message to revoke her previous state and acknowledge that she has received and committed to B1. This allows Bob to add B1 to his staging area commitment transaction.\n\nAfter the revocation and acknowledgment process, some HTLCs are irrevocably committed, while others are not yet committed by both parties. In this example, A1 and A2 have been irrevocably committed, but B1 and A3 have not.\n\nHTLCs can be removed when a payment succeeds (\"update_fulfill_htlc\" message) or fails (\"update_fail_htlc\" message). Only the peer who didn't send the original \"update_add_htlc\" message can send the removal messages. In this example, Bob sends Alice the \"update_fulfill_htlc\" message for HTLC A2, indicating that it has been fulfilled. The removal messages are initially pending on the receiver's side until acknowledged by a \"revoke_and_ack\" message.\n\nHTLCs can also be removed due to payment failures, such as timing out or routing failures. The \"update_fail_htlc\" message is used to communicate these failures. Bob sends Alice the \"update_fail_htlc\" message for HTLC A1, indicating the failure.\n\nAnother message, \"update_fail_malformed_htlc,\" is sent if any hop was unable to parse the onion routing packet in the \"update_add_htlc\" message. If Bob sends Alice this message for HTLC A3, indicating a failure to parse, the state is updated accordingly. Alice also initiates the removal of B1 by sending an \"update_fulfill_htlc\" message to Bob.\n\nTo irrevocably commit the HTLC removals, the commitment_signed-revoke_and_ack flow is performed. Finally, all the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed.\n\nNext, the blog post explains the \"update_fee\" message, which allows the funder of the channel to negotiate a fee for the final closing transaction. It mentions that with anchor channels, the need for the \"update_fee\" message is becoming less necessary because nodes can use Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP) on the force-close transaction.\n\nWhen a connection re-establishes, both sides need to remove any uncommitted updates from their staging area. This means they will need to re-transmit any update messages that were not yet committed on the other side's commitment transaction.\n\nFinally, the blog post discusses how cooperative channel closing works. In this case, Bob sends Alice the \"shutdown\" message to initiate the process. Once all the HTLCs are cleared, a negotiation on the fee for the final closing transaction can begin. Assuming Alice is the funder of the channel, she chooses a fee rate and constructs the closing transaction. She signs it and sends the \"closing_signed\" message to Bob. Bob can accept the proposal or send a counterproposal with a different fee rate. Either party can now broadcast the closing transaction to the Bitcoin network, and the channel will officially be closed.\n\nThe blog post concludes by highlighting the benefit of payment channels, where multiple HTLCs can be sent back and forth without significantly affecting the on-chain transactions.",
      "summaryeli15": "This blog post is discussing the process of opening, using, and closing a payment channel between two parties, Alice and Bob. It assumes some prior knowledge of concepts and terms related to bitcoin and payment channels.\n\nAt the beginning, Alice and Bob have successfully opened their channel by creating a funding transaction that has been confirmed. They have also exchanged messages indicating that they are ready to use the channel. The blog post focuses on the process of adding and removing HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contract) outputs, which are used to facilitate payments across the channel.\n\nWhen either Alice or Bob wants to send a payment across the channel, they propose the inclusion of an HTLC to their channel peer using the `update_add_htlc` message. This message includes information such as the amount to be sent, the expiration block height, and data for routing the payment.\n\nIf Bob is happy with the proposed HTLC, he adds it to his staging area commitment transaction. Alice marks the HTLC as pending on Bob's side, but does not yet add it to her staging commitment transaction. It's important to note that neither side has committed to the HTLC yet, so if Bob is a routing node for this payment, he should not forward it until the HTLC is irrevocably committed by both parties.\n\nThe value of Alice's main output in Bob's staging commitment transaction is adjusted to account for the added HTLC. If the HTLC succeeds, the amount will be added to Bob's output, and if it fails, it will be added back to Alice's output.\n\nEven if an HTLC has not been committed yet, both Alice and Bob can continue adding more changes to the staging area. Alice can propose another HTLC, and Bob can do the same.\n\nAt some point, one of the peers will want to make sure the other peer has committed to the latest set of changes and revoke the previous valid state. This is done by sending the `commitment_signed` message. In the example, Alice sends this message to Bob, who then has all the required signatures to broadcast his staging-area commitment transaction.\n\nIt's important to understand that the commitment transactions can remain out of sync for a while, and each party does not need to send the `commitment_signed` message just because the other party did. They can continue adding changes without committing to them yet.\n\nOnce both parties have sent the necessary messages to commit to the HTLCs, they can be considered irrevocably committed. In the example, A1 and A2 have been irrevocably committed, but B1 and A3 have not yet been committed by both parties.\n\nAfter the HTLCs have been irrevocably committed, they can be removed if the payment succeeds or fails. HTLCs are removed using the `update_fulfill_htlc` or `update_fail_htlc` messages. These removal messages can only be sent by the peer who did not send the original `update_add_htlc` message. In the example, Bob sends the `update_fulfill_htlc` message for HTLC A2, while Alice removes A2 from her staging area transaction.\n\nHTLCs can also be removed due to payment failures, and this is communicated using the `update_fail_htlc` message. In the example, Bob sends the `update_fail_htlc` message for HTLC A1.\n\nAdditionally, the `update_fail_malformed_htlc` message can be sent if a hop was unable to parse the onion routing packet in the `update_add_htlc` message.\n\nOnce the HTLCs have been removed, Alice and Bob can start negotiating a fee for the final closing transaction of the channel. The party that funded the channel initiates this negotiation. In the example, Alice initiates it. She chooses a fee rate, completes the closing transaction, signs it, and sends the `closing_signed` message to Bob.\n\nBob can either accept Alice's proposal or make a counterproposal with a different fee rate. This negotiation continues until they reach an agreement. The closing transaction is then broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and eventually confirmed, officially closing the channel.\n\nFinally, the blog post highlights that throughout the lifetime of the channel, multiple HTLCs can be added and removed, but on-chain, only the opening and closing transactions are visible.",

      "summary": "In summary, ACINQ is a developer and operator of the Lightning Network, which is a payment network built on top of Bitcoin. However, operating a Lightning Network node poses security challenges because private keys need to be \"hot\" or always online. To address these challenges, ACINQ has spent years researching and developing a secure setup for their Lightning node.\n\nTheir chosen solution involves using AWS Nitro Enclaves, which is an isolated compute environment, and Ledger Nano, which is a signing device with a trusted display. This setup provides a good balance between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity.\n\nThe Lightning Network is an open network of nodes that relay payments, and these nodes need to be reachable from the internet, process real-time transactions, and manage private keys. As such, Lightning nodes are considered hot wallets and are prime targets for hackers.\n\nACINQ has developed an open-source Lightning implementation called Eclair, which is specifically designed for large workloads. It is written in Scala and runs on the JVM, and it can easily scale to a large number of payment channels with high transaction volume.\n\nACINQ's Lightning node, which is powered by Eclair, currently manages hundreds of BTC and tens of thousands of channels. They expect these numbers to grow in the coming years, along with the level of risk. Therefore, they recognized the importance of security from the beginning and invested in researching it about four years ago.\n\nInitially, ACINQ planned to use a hardware security module (HSM) to protect their private keys. However, since their node runs on AWS, they couldn't simply plug a physical card into the servers. Additionally, they wanted to maintain the flexibility provided by a cloud provider like AWS.\n\nTo solve this, they split their deployment and created an HSM application that runs on AWS Nitro Enclaves. However, ensuring the HSM blindly signs whatever Eclair sends would not be secure enough. They needed to attach some context to the signing process. This required implementing a subset of the Lightning protocol on the HSM, which proved to be challenging due to the device's limitations.\n\nAnother issue they encountered was the need for the HSM to have knowledge of the Bitcoin blockchain to verify the validity of channels. They had to find a way to work with Bitcoin data without implementing a full node in the HSM, which added additional complexity.\n\nDespite their efforts in developing an HSM solution, they faced major challenges such as high development and maintenance costs, operational burden, and performance limitations. It also required managing multiple parts of the application across different locations and ensuring they stay synchronized.\n\nTo address these issues, ACINQ turned to AWS Nitro Enclaves and built a secure master repository for their secrets using Nitro Enclaves. Secrets are encrypted and packaged on an air-gapped machine and then uploaded to the master enclave. When the Lightning node starts, it retrieves the secrets through a secure tunnel.\n\nThey also use Ledger Nano devices to secure sensitive operations and sign applications. The Ledger devices' trusted display complements the security provided by Nitro Enclaves.\n\nAdditionally, ACINQ has developed a custom Ledger application and configured different devices for application deployment and management. They have whitelisted each Ledger device, and administrators use them to sign packages and approve sensitive requests.\n\nBitcoin Core is also integrated into their setup, with Eclair running inside a Nitro Enclave to monitor the Bitcoin blockchain securely. They verify transactions, detect when they are spent, and protect against eclipse attacks.\n\nACINQ's solution with AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger hardware wallets provides a secure runtime, protects against various security risks, simplifies operational tasks, and ensures compatibility with the Lightning node. Their setup remains independent from Nitro, allowing for easy deployment and upgrades without the need for physical access to their air-gapped machine.",
      "summaryeli15": "ACINQ is a company that develops and operates the Lightning Network, which is a payment network built on top of Bitcoin. The Lightning Network allows for fast and scalable transactions on Bitcoin. However, operating a Lightning node, which is essentially a hot wallet, poses serious security challenges.\n\nTo address these security challenges, ACINQ has spent years researching how to secure their Lightning node. They have settled on a combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano devices. AWS Nitro Enclaves provide an isolated compute environment, while Ledger Nano is a signing device with a trusted display. This setup offers a balance between security, flexibility, performance, and operational complexity.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a network of nodes that relay payments. These nodes are reachable from the internet, process real-time transactions, and manage private keys that control the funds. This makes Lightning nodes a prime target for hackers. ACINQ operates a Lightning node called Eclair, which manages hundreds of bitcoins and tens of thousands of channels.\n\nSecuring a Lightning node is not as simple as protecting a few private keys. ACINQ initially considered using a hardware security module (HSM), which is a device that securely stores cryptographic keys. However, since their node runs on AWS, they couldn't simply plug a physical HSM into the servers. They also didn't want to lose the flexibility of a cloud provider like AWS. So they split their deployment and developed software for the HSM.\n\nRouting payments on the Lightning Network is a complex task that involves matching incoming and outgoing payments. To enable the HSM to perform this task, it needs to understand the Lightning protocol and implement some of its features. Implementing the Lightning protocol on an HSM is challenging due to its embedded nature, specific OS, and limited memory.\n\nACINQ had to store encrypted data on the HSM's host filesystem and pass it back and forth for each payment. This added complexity to their deployment. They also had to ensure that the HSM had knowledge of the blockchain to prevent attackers from feeding it bogus payments. This required implementing a way for the HSM to authenticate channels and verify transactions.\n\nAfter spending years developing a Lightning implementation for an off-the-shelf HSM, ACINQ discovered AWS Nitro Enclaves, which offered a superior solution for their use case. They designed a new solution that involved using Nitro Enclaves and Ledger Nano devices. Running Eclair on Nitro Enclaves provided a secure runtime, while Ledger devices were used for sensitive operations like signing applications and performing management tasks.\n\nACINQ uses a custom protocol called \"LINK\" to manage network connections within the Nitro Enclave and on the host. They also leverage Nitro Attestations to establish secure tunnels between their application and the master repository where secrets are stored. They use Ledger devices to securely inject secrets into the master repository and to sign applications and perform sensitive administration tasks.\n\nThe deployment of Eclair on Nitro Enclaves is done through a launcher application, which decouples the lifecycle of the Nitro Enclave image from the lifecycle of Eclair. The launcher verifies the signature of the image, sets up secure channels to retrieve application secrets, creates network proxies, and starts Eclair.\n\nNitro Enclaves also enhance the security of Bitcoin Core, the underlying software that powers the Bitcoin blockchain. Eclair, running inside a Nitro Enclave, monitors the blockchain, verifies transactions, and protects against eclipse attacks. Bitcoin Core benefits from the security provided by the Nitro Enclave runtime, ensuring the integrity of the Bitcoin data.\n\nThe deployment and maintenance of Eclair on Nitro Enclaves have minimal impact on ACINQ's developers. They can still deploy new versions of Eclair and modify configurations using a similar process as before, with the added step of signing packages with a Ledger device. The performance and provisioning of their application remain the same.\n\nOverall, ACINQ's solution with AWS Nitro Enclaves and Ledger hardware wallets provides a secure and maintainable environment for their Lightning node. It offers a balance between security, cost, and operational ease, allowing them to protect their funds and ensure the smooth operation of their Lightning node.",

      "summary": "The given text describes several different concepts related to blockchain programming languages and the Simplicity programming language in particular. Here is a breakdown of each concept:\n\n1. API for managing digital assets on the Liquid Network: The Liquid Network is a sidechain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. An API is a set of functions and protocols that allows developers to interact with a system or platform. In this case, the API provides functionality for issuing and managing digital assets on the Liquid Network.\n\n2. Real-time and historical cryptocurrency trade data: This refers to data related to cryptocurrency trading, including the prices, volumes, and other relevant information, both in real-time and historically.\n\n3. Open-source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform: A sidechain is a separate blockchain that operates in conjunction with a main blockchain, allowing for additional functionality and scalability. The mentioned platform is open-source, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.\n\n4. Fully open-source hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid: A hardware wallet is a physical device that securely stores cryptocurrency private keys offline. The mentioned wallet is open-source, which means that the design and implementation details of the wallet are available to the public.\n\n5. Multi-platform Bitcoin and Liquid wallet: This refers to a software application or platform that allows users to manage their Bitcoin and Liquid assets from multiple devices and operating systems.\n\n6. Search data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains: Users can query and retrieve specific data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains using search functionality provided by the programming language or platform.\n\n7. Simplicity programming language: Simplicity is a programming language specifically designed for writing blockchain programs. It is different from most programming languages in that expressions are constructed using combinators, which can build up larger expressions from smaller ones. Simplicity represents functions that take input and produce output.\n\n8. Bit inversion: Bit inversion is a bitwise operation that flips the value of each bit in a binary number. The example given demonstrates how bit inversion can be achieved in different programming languages, including Simplicity.\n\n9. Writing Simplicity programs: Simplicity code can be written to perform various tasks, including bit inversion. However, as the complexity of blockchain programs increases, the expectation is that higher-level languages will be used to write code that compiles down to Simplicity code, along with proofs of their correct operation.\n\n10. Trivial input and output values: Trivial expressions in Simplicity are called programs. These expressions take empty inputs and produce empty outputs. Although there is only one function that maps a trivial input to a trivial output, these expressions are still useful and are the only ones allowed on the blockchain.\n\n11. Simplicity programs with holes and side effects: Simplicity programs can have holes that are filled in when coins are spent. These holes can be specified using disconnect and witness combinators. Simplicity programs can also have side effects, which allow them to access blockchain data or abort early using assertions.\n\n12. Witnesses and assertions: Witnesses are values that serve as inputs for Simplicity programs. They can be used to provide information like digital signatures or hash preimages. Assertions, on the other hand, halt program execution and can be used to validate certain conditions or data.\n\n13. Combinators in Simplicity: Combinators are building blocks used to construct Simplicity expressions. The given example demonstrates the use of combinators such as pair, case, injl, and comp to create a program that checks the equality of two witnesses.\n\nOverall, the text provides an overview of various concepts and features related to blockchain programming, Simplicity language, and the design principles behind them.",
      "summaryeli15": "Sure! I'll break down each part of the given text in detail.\n\n1. An API to issue and manage digital assets on the Liquid Network:\nAn API is an application programming interface, which is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In this case, the API is designed for issuing and managing digital assets on the Liquid Network. The Liquid Network is a sidechain of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables faster and more confidential transactions.\n\n2. Real-time and historical cryptocurrency trade data:\nThis refers to the availability of real-time and historical data about trades made with cryptocurrencies. It means you can access information about past trades as well as the current state of the market in real-time.\n\n3. An open-source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform:\nThis describes a blockchain platform that is both open-source and capable of supporting sidechains. Open-source means that the source code of the platform is publicly available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. Sidechains are separate blockchains that are connected to and can interact with the main blockchain.\n\n4. A fully open-source hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid:\nA hardware wallet is a physical device designed to securely store cryptocurrency keys and enable transactions. In this case, the hardware wallet is developed as open-source, meaning the design and source code are publicly available.\n\n5. A multi-platform, feature-rich Bitcoin and Liquid wallet:\nThis refers to a wallet application that can be used on multiple platforms (such as mobile, desktop, or web) and supports both Bitcoin and Liquid cryptocurrencies. It is described as \"feature-rich,\" indicating that it offers a broad range of functions and capabilities.\n\n6. Search data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains:\nThis means you can search and retrieve specific information or data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains. It allows you to access and analyze blockchain data programmatically.\n\nMoving on to Simplicity, it is a programming language specifically designed for writing code on the blockchain. Unlike most other programming languages, Simplicity expressions are built using combinators, which are small building blocks that can be combined to create more complex expressions. These expressions represent functions that take inputs and produce outputs.\n\nThe simplest Simplicity program mentioned is \"main := iden,\" which takes an empty input and produces an empty output. It doesn't perform any computation or produce any meaningful result.\n\nBit inversion, which reverses the bits of a binary number, is given as an example. Simplicity code may seem verbose and longer compared to other languages for simple operations like bit inversion. However, this is not a problem in practice because such code is usually written once and then reused. For instance, a shortcut called \"jet_not\" can be used instead of writing the lengthy code for bit inversion manually.\n\nIt is worth noting that in practice, most people won't be writing Simplicity code directly. Higher-level languages will be used, which will then compile down to Simplicity code along with proofs of their correct operation.\n\nPrograms in Simplicity that have trivial input and output values are called \"expressions.\" These expressions are essentially programs that map empty inputs to empty outputs. While it might not seem immediately useful, they are the only type of expressions allowed on the blockchain.\n\nSimplicity allows for two strategies to be used. The first is that Simplicity programs committed in addresses contain holes that are only filled when coins are spent. The second strategy involves side effects, which allow Simplicity programs to access blockchain data or abort early. This means Simplicity is not limited to pure mathematical functions.\n\nThere are two ways to specify holes in Simplicity programs: \"disconnect\" and \"witness\" combinators. The \"disconnect\" combinator is a bit subtle and not explained further in this text. However, the \"witness\" combinator is simple and returns a value of a specific type, such as a digital signature, hash preimage, or a specific choice of signing keys.\n\nSimplicity also supports side effects through introspecting transaction data and using assertions. Introspection allows programs to access transaction data, while assertions halt program execution. In Bitcoin Script, the \"VERIFY\" opcode is used for assertions, and in EVM, the \"STOP\" opcode serves the same purpose.\n\nThe author explains that witnesses serve as program inputs, while assertions act as a \"pass/fail\" program output. An example is provided where a program takes two witnesses and checks if they are equal.\n\nThe text mentions that Simplicity has several more combinators and many \"jets.\" Jets are shortcuts or pre-built code snippets that perform specific operations. The author promises to explore more practical examples and discuss proving properties of Simplicity programs in future posts.\n\nIn summary, Simplicity is a language specifically designed for writing code on the blockchain. It offers a foundation for building blockchain programs, supporting features like issuing digital assets, accessing trade data, and managing wallets. While its code may look verbose for simple operations, it provides flexibility and integration with higher-level languages. Ultimately, actual programming in Simplicity will likely be done through such higher-level languages.",

      "summary": "This passage is discussing a concept called a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains. To understand this concept, let's break it down.\n\nA pegged cryptocurrency is a digital currency that has a fixed value relative to another asset or currency. In this case, the peg is between Bitcoin (BTC) and other chains, which could be other cryptocurrencies or blockchain networks.\n\nThe passage mentions a similarity to a perpetual one-way peg. A one-way peg typically involves a process where BTC is sent to a specific address on the Bitcoin network and then \"burned,\" meaning it is made permanently inaccessible. In a perpetual one-way peg, the BTC is continuously locked up and cannot be accessed by the original owner. However, the passage describes a different approach.\n\nIn this scenario, the BTC is not burned, but rather locked up until a particular time in 20 years. This means that the BTC cannot be spent or moved until that predetermined time has passed. During this period, the community needs to come up with a solution for peg-outs, which refers to the process of moving the locked BTC to another chain.\n\nThe passage suggests using something called OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity to facilitate the peg-outs. OP_ZKP_VERIFY stands for \"Zero-Knowledge Proof Verify,\" which is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove to another party that a particular statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Simplicity is a programming language specifically designed for creating and verifying smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nTo lock the BTC, the passage suggests using the OP_NOP10 opcode, which stands for \"No Operation.\" This opcode does nothing in terms of functionality but can be repurposed for specific use cases. In this case, OP_NOP10 is treated as OP_ZKP_VERIFY to enable the locking of the BTC in the script.\n\nThe passage mentions that the design of OP_ZKP_VERIFY is such that it reads certain data from the stack, which is a data structure used in programming to store and manage information. The unlocking script, which contains the necessary information to prove ownership and authorize the transfer of the locked BTC, is also referenced.\n\nThe more coins that are locked in this script, the greater the incentive or motivation for the community to solve the problem of peg-outs and find a way to unlock and transfer the BTC to other chains.\n\nThe idea behind this concept was initially proposed by Burak, with additional input and development assistance from individuals named Super Testnet and Jeremy Rubin. It is noted that this concept bears similarity to Jeremy Rubin's idea for betting on Taproot activation, although details on this connection are not provided in the passage.\n\nFinally, the passage concludes with the mention of OP_CLTV and OP_2DROP. OP_CLTV, which stands for \"Check Lock Time Verify,\" is an opcode used to enforce time-based conditions for transaction outputs. OP_2DROP is an opcode that removes the top two items from the stack.\n\nIn summary, the passage outlines a methodology for bridging BTC to other chains using a two-way peg. The BTC is locked up until a specific time in 20 years, and the community needs to find a solution for peg-outs through the use of OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity. The locking process involves repurposing OP_NOP10, and the more coins locked in the script, the greater the incentive for solving the peg-out problem. The idea was developed collaboratively, building upon similar concepts proposed by other individuals. OP_CLTV and OP_2DROP also have roles in this process.",
      "summaryeli15": "At first glance, this might seem like complicated jargon, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nA two-way peg is a concept that allows for the transfer of Bitcoin (BTC) to other blockchains. It is similar to a one-way peg, where BTC is locked up and can only be used on the other chain, but with a two-way peg, there is an additional element.\n\nIn this case, instead of burning or destroying the BTC, they are locked up for a specific period of time, which in this example is 20 years. This means that the BTC cannot be accessed or moved until that time has passed.\n\nDuring this period, the community needs to come up with a solution for peg-outs. Peg-outs refer to the process of moving the locked BTC back to the original chain.\n\nTo facilitate this, the community suggests using something called OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity. These are technical terms and methods that can be used to enable the movement of the locked BTC. Without going into too much detail, let's just say that these processes involve verifying certain information in a secure and efficient manner.\n\nTo lock the BTC, the users would need to execute a specific script. In this script, there is an instruction called OP_ZKP_VERIFY, which essentially acts as a placeholder for another operation called OP_NOP10.\n\nThe use of OP_ZKP_VERIFY or OP_NOP10 is crucial because it allows the script to interact with the stack, which is a data structure used by the Bitcoin system to hold and process information. By reading from the stack, the script can access the necessary data to execute the locking process.\n\nThe more BTC that is locked up using this script, the greater the incentive for the community to find a solution for the peg-outs. This means that if there are a lot of locked BTC, it becomes more important for the community to work on solving the problem.\n\nThe key idea for this concept was developed by someone named Burak. Additionally, the idea was further developed and documented by individuals referred to as Super Testnet and \"I\" (presumably the author of the explanation).\n\nLastly, the mention of Jeremy Rubin and Taproot activation refers to another idea or concept related to Bitcoin's technical development, but it is not directly connected to the main topic of the two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains.\n\nIn summary, this concept of a two-way peg bridging BTC to other chains involves locking up BTC for a specific period of time and using specific methods, such as OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity, to enable the movement of the locked BTC. The community is incentivized to find solutions for peg-outs, and the idea was developed collaboratively by a team of individuals.",
