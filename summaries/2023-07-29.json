      "summary": "In this conversation, the participants are discussing the security and practicality of using blind signing services in various cryptographic protocols such as MuSig, MuSig2, and FROST. Blind signing is a technique where a signer is unable to see the message they are signing, ensuring privacy and preventing the signer from learning any information about the message.\n\nThe first statement made is that not having proof of knowledge of each R (which represents the ephemeral keys used in the signing process) does not protect against Wagner's attack. Wagner's attack is a specific type of attack that exploits the use of identical random values during the signing process to extract private keys. \n\nThe second statement suggests that a generic blind signing service can be used for protocols like MuSig, MuSig2, and FROST without the blind signing service being aware of the specific protocol being used. The participant suggests that adding the MuSig tweak (an additional parameter specific to MuSig) to the key during the blind signing request should be sufficient. They also mention that the server having multiple nonces (random values) like in MuSig2 does not improve the server's security significantly.\n\nThe participant mentions that the main problem is creating a secure blind Schnorr signing service. Schnorr signatures are a type of digital signature algorithm known for their efficiency and security. They also mention that Jonas referred to some papers that explain how to create a secure blind Schnorr signing service.\n\nThe conversation includes references to previous messages that discuss the importance of proof of knowledge of the ephemeral keys (r values) used in the signing process to prevent attacks. It is mentioned that proving knowledge of the signing key, also known as proof of possession (PoP), does not prevent attacks such as the Wagner attack or attacks on the nonces or the challenge.\n\nOverall, the conversation revolves around the security considerations and practical implementations of blind signing services in various cryptographic protocols. The participants discuss the importance of proof of knowledge, the potential vulnerabilities and attacks, and the need for a secure blind Schnorr signing service.",
      "summaryeli15": "In this conversation, the participants are discussing the security of blind signing services and the use of various signing protocols. Blind signing is a cryptographic technique that allows a party to sign a message without knowing its content, ensuring privacy and security.\n\nThe first statement states that the lack of proof of knowledge of each individual \"R\" does not prevent what is known as Wagner's attack. Wagner's attack is a type of attack that targets the security of cryptographic protocols and can potentially lead to the exposure of private keys.\n\nThe second statement suggests that a generic blind signing service can be used for protocols such as MuSig, MuSig2, FROST, etc., without the blind signing service having knowledge of those specific protocols. The OP (original poster) suggests that adding the necessary parameters, such as the MuSig tweak or BIP32, to the key during the blind signing request can achieve compatibility with these protocols. This approach eliminates the need for a specialized MuSig2 blind signing service.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the topic of multiple nonces in MuSig2. Nonces are random numbers that are used to ensure the uniqueness of cryptographic operations. It is mentioned that having multiple nonces in MuSig2 does not necessarily enhance the security of the server. The focus is then redirected to the creation of a secure blind Schnorr signing service, as mentioned by Jonas, who references papers that discuss methods for achieving this.\n\nThe conversation continues with Erik stating that one cannot select \"R\" if it is shipped with a \"POP\" (proof of possession). This statement implies that the selection of \"R\" is restricted based on the proof of possession, which can limit the potential for attacks.\n\nTom contributes to the conversation by stating that proof of knowledge of the ephemeral keys (r values) used to generate each \"R\" can prevent the Wagner attack. Ephemeral keys are temporary cryptographic keys used for specific operations. Proof of knowledge ensures that the participant has the necessary knowledge and control over these keys.\n\nIn response to Tom's comment, Jonas clarifies that none of the attacks discussed in the conversation so far (including attacks on nonces and the challenge c) can be prevented by simply proving knowledge of the signing key (proof of possession). Proof of possession, also known as PoP, refers to providing evidence that the participant possesses the private key corresponding to the public key being used for signing.\n\nOverall, the conversation revolves around the security of blind signing services, the compatibility of different signing protocols, the role of multiple nonces, the selection of \"R\" values, and the importance of proof of knowledge and possession in protecting against potential attacks.",

Wagner's attack is a known attack in cryptography that aims to break the security of a cryptographic algorithm by providing carefully crafted inputs. It is unclear how exactly \"R\" is related to this attack, as it is not further explained in the given text.\n\nThe second point discusses the use of a generic blind signing service for performing blinded signing operations. The author suggests that such a service can be used for protocols like MuSig and MuSig2 without the service being aware of the specific protocol being used. It is proposed to include the MuSig tweak, BIP32 (a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal related to hierarchical deterministic wallets), or other relevant keys when making the blind signing request. The addition of these keys allows for the extraction of MuSig2 compatible shares without the need for a specialized MuSig2 blind signing service.\n\nThe statement emphasizes that the server's security is not enhanced by having multiple nonces, as it would be in MuSig2. The focus shifts to the creation of a secure blind Schnorr signing service, suggesting that it is the main challenge in this context. The author mentions that Jonas has referred to some papers that explain how to achieve this security, but integrating those techniques into a protocol may pose difficulties.\n\nThe following part of the text includes a quoted email conversation between Erik Aronesty and Tom Trevethan. It seems that they are discussing the importance of the r values (ephemeral keys) in preventing the Wagner attack. Tom suggests that proof of knowledge of the r values used to generate each R can prevent the attack, but it is not further discussed or explained.\n\nThe email conversation ends there, and there is a mention of an HTML attachment that has been scrubbed, so it is not included in the given text.\n\nIn conclusion, the discussion revolves around the security aspects and practical implementation challenges of blind signing services for various cryptographic protocols. The text touches upon topics like the Wagner attack, the use of generic blind signing services, and the need for secure blind Schnorr signing services.

      "summaryeli15": "In this message, the author is discussing the topic of blind signing services and their security in the context of cryptographic protocols such as MuSig, MuSig2, and FROST.\n\nBlind signing is a cryptographic technique where a signer, who possesses a private key, signs a message without knowledge of the content of the message itself. This is done by using a blinding factor that hides the message during the signing process. The signer only sees the blinded message and signs it, without knowing what the actual message is.\n\nThe author makes a couple of points in their message. First, they state that the absence of proof of knowledge of each R (a variable used in the signing algorithm) does not prevent an attack known as Wagner's attack. Wagner's attack is a method of exploiting weak randomness in a cryptographic scheme, and in this context, it refers to a specific attack on blind signing protocols.\n\nNext, the author suggests that a generic blind signing service can be used for protocols like MuSig, MuSig2, or FROST without the service being aware of the specific protocol being used. They argue that it is not necessary to have a specialized blind signing service specifically designed for a particular protocol. Instead, they propose that the MuSig tweak (an additional step in the signing process to improve security) can be added to the key used in the blind signing request. This would allow compatibility with MuSig or other protocols without requiring a dedicated blind signing service for each protocol.\n\nThe author also mentions the concept of nonces, which are random numbers used in the signing process to ensure that each signature is unique. They state that having multiple nonces in the server, as is done in MuSig2, does not improve the server's security. It seems the author believes that the main challenge in creating a secure blind schnorr signing service (a type of digital signature algorithm) is to ensure the blind signing process itself is secure.\n\nIn response to the author's points, another person in the discussion argues that proof of knowledge of the r values (ephemeral keys) used to generate each R can prevent the Wagner attack. This refers to proving that the signer knows the specific values used in the blinding process, adding an additional level of security.\n\nOverall, the discussion revolves around the security considerations and practical implementation of blind signing services in different cryptographic protocols. It touches on topics such as random number generation, protocol compatibility, and the challenges of creating a secure blind schnorr signing service.",

This can be useful in scenarios where privacy or anonymity is desired.\n\nThe first statement mentions that lacking proof of knowledge of each value called \"R\" does not prevent an attack known as \"Wagner's attack.\" This attack refers to a specific vulnerability in the blind signing process where an adversary can manipulate the values involved to gather information about the signer's private key.\n\nThe second statement argues that a generic blind signing service can be sufficient for implementing protocols like MuSig2 without requiring a specialized blind signing service specifically designed for MuSig2.

Proof of knowledge of these \"r\" values, used to generate each \"R\" value (used in the signing process), can prevent Wagner's attack. Proof of knowledge of a key or value demonstrates that the prover possesses the corresponding secret information.\n\nLastly, the conversation includes mentions of an attack on the nonces (ephemeral keys or random values) and an attack on the challenge \"c\" (a value used in cryptographic schemes).
